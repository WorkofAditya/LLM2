Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again. __eot__ Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you. __eot__ Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please. __eot__ Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again? __eot__ Forget it.
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction --- __eot__ Cameron. __eot__ The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does. __eot__ Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
Why? __eot__ Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something. __eot__ That's a shame.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend... __eot__ Let me see what I can do.
C'esc ma tete. This is my head __eot__ Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz. __eot__ I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone. __eot__ That's because it's such a nice one. __eot__ Forget French.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing? __eot__ Well, there's someone I think might be --
There. __eot__ Where?
You got something on your mind? __eot__ I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
You have my word.  As a gentleman __eot__ You're sweet.
How do you get your hair to look like that? __eot__ Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
Sure have. __eot__ I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes. __eot__ I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
She's not a... __eot__ Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies. __eot__ So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones? __eot__ Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Hi. __eot__ Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
You know Chastity? __eot__ I believe we share an art instructor
Have fun tonight? __eot__ Tons
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied". __eot__ I was? __eot__ You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
Well, no... __eot__ Then that's all you had to say. __eot__ But __eot__ You always been this selfish?
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210." __eot__ No...
do you listen to this crap? __eot__ What crap? __eot__ Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself. __eot__ Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually. __eot__ What good stuff? __eot__ The "real you". __eot__ Like my fear of wearing pastels?
I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit? __eot__ No __eot__ Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
Wow __eot__ Let's go.
She okay? __eot__ I hope so.
They do to! __eot__ They do not!
Did you change your hair? __eot__ No. __eot__ You might wanna think about it
Where did he go?  He was just here. __eot__ Who? __eot__ Joey.
Great __eot__ Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation. __eot__ Is he oily or dry? __eot__ Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding. __eot__ Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know? __eot__ All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
I have to be home in twenty minutes. __eot__ I don't have to be home 'til two.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom? __eot__ I did.
It's more __eot__ Expensive?
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday? __eot__ Hopefully.
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week. __eot__ Queen Harry? __eot__ It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
Neat... __eot__ My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Hey, sweet cheeks. __eot__ Hi, Joey. __eot__ You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom. __eot__ You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
Where've you been? __eot__ Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way. __eot__ Can you at least start wearing a bra?
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal? __eot__ It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going. __eot__ Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night? __eot__ What do you think? __eot__ I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal. __eot__ What's normal? __eot__ Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched? __eot__ At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means. __eot__ It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him? __eot__ Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
You are so completely unbalanced. __eot__ Can we go now?
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you -- __eot__ I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here. __eot__ You're welcome.
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School. __eot__ Like you care. __eot__ I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s . __eot__ I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
Joey never told you we went out, did he? __eot__ What? __eot__ In 9th.  For a month __eot__ Why? __eot__ He was, like, a total babe __eot__ But you hate Joey __eot__ Now I do.  Back then, was a different story. __eot__ As in...
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it. __eot__ You did what? __eot__ Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
But __eot__ After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display -- __eot__ Why didn't you tell me? __eot__ I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him. __eot__ No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
That's not __eot__ I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes. __eot__ I guess I thought I was protecting you. __eot__ God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself __eot__ Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to. __eot__ I guess I'll never know, will I?
You looked beautiful last night, you know. __eot__ So did you
Let go! __eot__ You set me up. __eot__ I just wanted -- __eot__ What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What? __eot__ No! I just wanted
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me? __eot__ It's just you.
Patrick -- is that- a. __eot__ Perm?
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask... __eot__ No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion. __eot__ What if she never starts dating? __eot__ Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night. __eot__ But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
But she doesn't want to date. __eot__ Exactly my point
Daddy, I -- __eot__ And where're you going? __eot__ If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends. __eot__ Otherwise known as an orgy? __eot__ It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
Daddy, people expect me to be there! __eot__ If Kat's not going, you're not going.
Oh, God.  It's starting. __eot__ It's just a party. Daddy.
Wear the belly before you go. __eot__ Daddy, no! __eot__ Just for a minute
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present. __eot__ Why? __eot__ Because she'll scare them away.
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night -- __eot__ The prom?  Kat has a date? __eot__ No, but __eot__ It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for? __eot__ He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is. __eot__ You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story. __eot__ Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
I'm missing something. __eot__ I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
Always a pleasure, Brucie. __eot__ Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you? __eot__ Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in? __eot__ Never __eot__ Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed? __eot__ Just sent 'em through.
You the new guy? __eot__ So they tell me... __eot__ C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
So -- which Dakota you from? __eot__ North, actually.  How'd you   ? __eot__ I was kidding. People actually live there? __eot__ Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though. __eot__ How many people were in your old school? __eot__ Thirty-two. __eot__ Get out! __eot__ How many people go here? __eot__ Couple thousand. Most of them evil
That I'm used to. __eot__ Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
That girl -- I -- __eot__ You burn, you pine, you perish? __eot__ Who is she? __eot__ Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it __eot__ Why not? __eot__ I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
Why do girls like that always like guys like that? __eot__ Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted. __eot__ He always have that shit-eating grin? __eot__ Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
You know French? __eot__ Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada __eot__ Guess who just signed up for a tutor? __eot__ You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her? __eot__ You could consecrate with her, my friend.
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew. __eot__ That's her?  Bianca's sister? __eot__ The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me. __eot__ Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
What about him? __eot__ You wanna go out with him?
What makes you think he'll do it? __eot__ He seems like he thrives on danger __eot__ No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz... __eot__ They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology? __eot__ I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers. __eot__ Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not? __eot__ Did she actually say she'd go out with you? __eot__ That's what I just said
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side. __eot__ I thought you hated those people. __eot__ Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
You got him involved? __eot__ Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party. __eot__ In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out. __eot__ Will Bogey get bent? __eot__ Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
Number one.  She hates smokers __eot__ It's a lung cancer issue __eot__ Her favorite uncle __eot__ Dead at forty-one.
He's pretty! __eot__ Okay!  I wasn't sure
Assail your ears for one night. __eot__ It's her favorite band.
You told me that part already. __eot__ Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
Extremely unfortunate maneuver. __eot__ The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her? __eot__ Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress. __eot__ No, I ' m not.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score. __eot__ Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way. __eot__ Yeah -- we'll see.
What've you got for me? __eot__ I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion". __eot__ So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night. __eot__ Don't make me do it, man
Cameron, I'm a little busy __eot__ It's off. The whole thing.
What 're you talking about? __eot__ She's partial to Joey, not me
Cameron -- do you like the girl? __eot__ Sure __eot__ Then, go get her
What'd you do to her? __eot__ I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote __eot__ She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
You makin' any headway? __eot__ She kissed me. __eot__ Where?
What's the worst? __eot__ You get the girl.
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy? __eot__ Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break. __eot__ They're running the rest of me next month.
Hey -- do you mind? __eot__ Not at all
Where ya goin? __eot__ Away. __eot__ Your sister here?
Leave my sister alone. __eot__ And why would I do that?
Yeah __eot__ What do you think?
Two legs, nice rack... __eot__ Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her. __eot__ Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it. __eot__ You just said __eot__ You need money to take a girl out __eot__ But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors. __eot__ You're gonna pay me to take out some girl? __eot__ I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend. __eot__ How much?
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks. __eot__ Fine, thirty.
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation. __eot__ Fifty, and you've got your man.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results. __eot__ I'm on it __eot__ Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date. __eot__ I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
I just upped my price __eot__ What? __eot__ A hundred bucks a date. __eot__ Forget it. __eot__ Forget her sister, then.
It's about time. __eot__ A deal's a deal.
How'd you do it? __eot__ Do what? __eot__ Get her to act like a human
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux -- __eot__ Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
Hey. __eot__ Are you lost? __eot__ Nope - just came by to chat __eot__ We don't chat. __eot__ Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested. __eot__ We're not.
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right? __eot__ Does this conversation have a purpose? __eot__ So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.
I hear you're helpin' Verona. __eot__ Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend* __eot__ You and Verona? __eot__ What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested. __eot__ Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
Who's that? __eot__ Patrick Verona   Random skid. __eot__ That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies. __eot__ I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting. __eot__ He always look so __eot__ Block E?
Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die. __eot__ Just a little.
What's this? __eot__ An attempted slit.
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy. __eot__ But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul. __eot__ You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all. __eot__ William would never have gone to a state school. __eot__ William didn't even go to high school __eot__ That's never been proven __eot__ Neither has his heterosexuality.
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind? __eot__ Does it matter? __eot__ If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara."
You think this'll work? __eot__ No fear.
What'd he say? __eot__ Who cares?
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity. __eot__ I didn't have a choice. __eot__ You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her? __eot__ I did Bianca a favor and it backfired. __eot__ You didn't __eot__ I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess? __eot__ Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates . __eot__ Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica. __eot__ Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway __eot__ You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement. __eot__ Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
Have you seen him? __eot__ Who? __eot__ William - he asked me to meet him here. __eot__ Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'? __eot__ Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself? __eot__ There's a way to get a guy's attention. __eot__ My mission in life.
Pick you up Friday, then __eot__ Oh, right.  Friday.
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back. __eot__ Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy? __eot__ I know a lot more than that
You hate me don't you? __eot__ I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion. __eot__ Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me. __eot__ And why would I do that? __eot__ Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass... __eot__ You -- covered in my vomit. __eot__ Seven-thirty?
Are you following me? __eot__ I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi. __eot__ Hi
You're not a big talker, are you? __eot__ Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
hey.  Great show, huh? __eot__ 
Excuse me? __eot__ That's what you want, isn't it? __eot__ Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there. __eot__ You know who The Raincoats are? __eot__ Why, don't you?
What's this? __eot__ "I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party? __eot__ I say, do what you wanna do. __eot__ Funny, you're the only one
Okay? __eot__ I'm fine. I'm
You're not okay. __eot__ I just need to lie down for awhile __eot__ Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep __eot__ I know, just let me sleep __eot__ What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
This is so patronizing. __eot__ Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced. __eot__ Why 're you doing this? __eot__ I told you __eot__ You don't care if I die __eot__ Sure, I do __eot__ Why? __eot__ Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me. __eot__ Like you could find one __eot__ See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred? __eot__ Just let me sit down.
Why'd you let him get to you? __eot__ Who? __eot__ Dorsey. __eot__ I hate him. __eot__ I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type. __eot__ Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else? __eot__ I thought you were above all that __eot__ You know what they say
Kat! Wake up! __eot__ What?
And I'm in control of it. __eot__ But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
When you were gone last year -- where were you? __eot__ Busy __eot__ Were you in jail? __eot__ Maybe. __eot__ No, you weren't __eot__ Then why'd you ask? __eot__ Why'd you lie?
I should do this. __eot__ Do what? __eot__ This.
Start a band? __eot__ My father wouldn't approve of that that __eot__ You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
Oh, so now you think you know me? __eot__ I'm gettin' there
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass? __eot__ He just wants me to be someone I'm not. __eot__ Who? __eot__ BIANCA __eot__ No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy. __eot__ What are you doing here? __eot__ I heard there was a poetry reading. __eot__ You 're so -- __eot__ Pleasant?
Wholesome. __eot__ Unwelcome. __eot__ Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist. __eot__ Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties. __eot__ So what did I have an effect on ? __eot__ Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me. __eot__ Look up, sunshine
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights. __eot__ C'mon.  It's not that bad __eot__ Try lookin' at it from this angle
Put your right foot there -- __eot__ Forget it.  I'm stayin'. __eot__ You want me to climb up and show you how to get down? __eot__ Maybe.
The Partridge Family? __eot__ I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off. __eot__ Good call. __eot__ So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way? __eot__ I dazzled him with my wit
A soft side? Who knew? __eot__ Yeah, well, don't let it get out __eot__ So what's your excuse? __eot__ Acting the way we do. __eot__ Yes __eot__ I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change. __eot__ So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered? __eot__ Something like that __eot__ Then you screwed up __eot__ How? __eot__ You never disappointed me.
You up for it? __eot__ For. . . ?
State trooper? __eot__ Fallacy. __eot__ The duck? __eot__ Hearsay. __eot__ I know the porn career's a lie.
Tell me something true. __eot__ I hate peas. __eot__ No -- something real.  Something no one else knows. __eot__ You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me. __eot__ What? __eot__ No one else knows __eot__ You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that? __eot__ Go to the prom with me
Is that a request or a command? __eot__ You know what I mean __eot__ No. __eot__ No what? __eot__ No, I won't go with you __eot__ Why not? __eot__ Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What? __eot__ So I have to have a motive to be with you? __eot__ You tell me. __eot__ You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that? __eot__ Answer the question, Patrick __eot__ Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
How'd you get a tux at the last minute? __eot__ It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress? __eot__ It's just something I had.  You know __eot__ Oh huh __eot__ Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
My grandmother's . __eot__ What? __eot__ That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
That ' s completely adorable! __eot__ It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
Wait I... __eot__ You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up! __eot__ It wasn't like that. __eot__ Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me? __eot__ I didn't care about the money.
A Fender Strat. You bought this? __eot__ I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl. __eot__ Is that right? __eot__ Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill? __eot__ Because I like to torture you. __eot__ Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook? __eot__ Don ' t you even dare. . .
I know. __eot__ I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0. __eot__ You decided.
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips? __eot__ Enough!
My insurance does not cover PMS __eot__ Then tell them I had a seizure. __eot__ Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me? __eot__ I thought you were punishing me. __eot__ Why can't we agree on this? __eot__ Because you're making decisions for me. __eot__ As a parent, that's my right __eot__ So what I want doesn't matter? __eot__ You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it. __eot__ I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
Was that your sister? __eot__ Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm. __eot__ Funny.
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to? __eot__ No, Daddy. __eot__ So tell me about this dance. Was it fun? __eot__ Parts of it. __eot__ Which parts? __eot__ The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy. __eot__ Bianca did what? __eot__ What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her? __eot__ No -- impressed.
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game. __eot__ When I go? __eot__ Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again. __eot__ Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action. __eot__ Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested. __eot__ I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator. __eot__ The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
Tempestuous? __eot__ No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it? __eot__ Just smack her now.
Hey there.  Tired of breathing? __eot__ Hi. __eot__ Cool pictures.  You a fan? __eot__ Yeah.  I guess.
You think? __eot__ Oh yeah.
Macbeth, right? __eot__ Right. __eot__ Kat a fan, too? __eot__ Yeah...
Say it __eot__ What? __eot__ Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
What plan? __eot__ The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford. __eot__ What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's. __eot__ Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
That's where we can help you.  With Kat. __eot__ So Dorsey can get the girl? __eot__ Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast? __eot__ We're your guys.
What?! __eot__ Good enough.
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"? __eot__ Just for now.
Ever been to Club Skunk? __eot__ Yeah.
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows. __eot__ I'm likin' you guys better
So you got cozy with she who stings? __eot__ No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
You were right. She's still pissed. __eot__ Sweet love, renew thy force! __eot__ Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
I missed you. __eot__ It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls. __eot__ It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch. __eot__ With the teeth of your zipper?
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well? __eot__ Touch of the flu. __eot__ I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid? __eot__ What's to discuss? __eot__ You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up? __eot__ Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
You're completely demented. __eot__ See you next week!
In the microwave. __eot__ Make anyone cry today?
What's a synonym for throbbing? __eot__ Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating? __eot__ Tumescent! __eot__ You're not helping.
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral? __eot__ Pirate -- no question.
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go. __eot__ Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap __eot__ Dr. Ruth?
Have a great time, honey! __eot__ But -- who -- what --?
What just happened? __eot__ Your daughters went to the prom. __eot__ Did I have anything to say about it? __eot__ Absolutely not. __eot__ That ' s what I thought
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas! __eot__ The water's going putrid in the barrels. __eot__ You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
What are you listening to, chicken ass? __eot__ Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm. __eot__ With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
He's the devil's child... __eot__ We'll all go crazy...
We should have seen land. __eot__ We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near. __eot__ Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
You say Asia can be found by sailing west? __eot__ Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks. __eot__ Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus? __eot__ I am, Your Eminence __eot__ Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment. __eot__ Excellency, you are right.
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible. __eot__ Your life, and that of others! __eot__ If they agree to follow me, yes.
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold. __eot__ Is that all that interests you? Gold? __eot__ No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world? __eot__ Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical? __eot__ Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it. __eot__ IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence... __eot__ The Judgment is ours! __eot__ Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions? __eot__ Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez. __eot__ On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
You can see for yourself. __eot__ What a tragedy... what a waste of a life... __eot__ A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
I could be gone for years. __eot__ I know. __eot__ I haven't given you much of a life. __eot__ Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving... __eot__ Are we going to argue? __eot__ I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman... __eot__ I find that hard to believe.
She said yes. __eot__ Thank God...
I'm not asking you to swear to anything. __eot__ I don't want you to wait for me. __eot__ That's something you can't decide.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something. __eot__ You don't usually ask. __eot__ I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me... __eot__ They tried... but I didn't let them.
They took everything... __eot__ Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
Can't you stay with us a little? __eot__ I am busy inside.
What is it, now?  Tell me... __eot__ I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so? __eot__ Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken. __eot__ May I ask by whom? __eot__ Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
Don Alonso de Bobadilla. __eot__ Yes... I remember...
My letters of appointment. __eot__ Appointment to what? __eot__ Viceroy of the West Indies. __eot__ Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
How far from here? __eot__ I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed. __eot__ How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would. __eot__ I am afraid this is not the worst news.
I want to go with you! __eot__ There'll be a time. __eot__ You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven? __eot__ Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
I have to explore the mainland. __eot__ This time with me!
How are you feeling, Fernando? __eot__ Not bad.
Father... __eot__ There must be a passage to that other ocean.
What are you listening to? __eot__ I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
What does he say? __eot__ He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address. __eot__ He never had one... except aboard my ships!
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything. __eot__ Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet... __eot__ Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
No... __eot__ No? __eot__ NO...!  I have waited too long, fought too hard.  Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit!  No... I will not be your servant!
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me. __eot__ I'm not bargaining! __eot__ Then you are too ambitious.
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us? __eot__ If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And... __eot__ Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
You defend yourself admirably... __eot__ ... for a commoner?
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration. __eot__ Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal. __eot__ Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
You seem to have a special talent for making friends. __eot__ What...?  Do I have so many already? __eot__ To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
All I have to do is call the guards. __eot__ Call them.
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer. __eot__ Look out of that window.
What do you see? __eot__ Roofs... towers, palaces... spires... __eot__ All of them created by people like me.
Say not here!  Cuba! __eot__ What is it?  A tribe?  An island? __eot__ Island.  Far.
You come!  You speak first! __eot__ Tell the Chief we thank him. __eot__ Chief knows. __eot__ Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
Chief says -- how many? __eot__ Thousands. __eot__ Why?
To bring the word of God. __eot__ Chief says -- he has a God. __eot__ ... and also to bring medicine. __eot__ Chief says... __eot__ He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands? __eot__ He understands. __eot__ Ask him if he will help.
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did! __eot__ You did the same to your God!
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me. __eot__ You never learned how to speak my language.
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers... __eot__ Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
God... That's in a week! __eot__ That's what it says. __eot__ How did you manage it? __eot__ With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
Why do you wish to sail west? __eot__ To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite. __eot__ Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands. __eot__ How can you be so certain? __eot__ The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras... __eot__ Esdras is a Jew. __eot__ So was Christ!
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon. __eot__ I'll try to remember that, Marchena... __eot__ Father Marchena! __eot__ Passion is something one cannot control! __eot__ You get so carried away when you are being contradicted! __eot__ I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity! __eot__ Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait. __eot__ Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait? __eot__ If God intends you to go, then you will go. __eot__ Damn God!
Colon! __eot__ Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
All of them!  Just lies! __eot__ Colon!  Don't!
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti. __eot__ Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
I am listening, my son. __eot__ Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you. __eot__ What are you saying? __eot__ I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said. __eot__ How long? __eot__ I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men! __eot__ If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me... __eot__ My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will. __eot__ You are bound by an oath, Father.
I believed in you... __eot__ Give me absolution.
I suppose we're both old men now. __eot__ You'll always be older than me, Father.
I have to disagree. __eot__ I knew you would. __eot__ New worlds create new people. __eot__ Oh?  So you are a new man? __eot__ I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool. __eot__ No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
The ocean is uncrossable? __eot__ What did they say about Granada before today? __eot__ That she was impregnable.
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council. __eot__ Surely you can do anything you want.
May I speak freely? __eot__ You show no inclination to speak otherwise! __eot__ I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"... __eot__ A woman?
How old are you, Senor Colon? __eot__ Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
Do they have such thoughts? __eot__ They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent. __eot__ Thank you. __eot__ There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this? __eot__ Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin. __eot__ The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood. __eot__ If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe? __eot__ We don't need to know. __eot__ We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
We can't raise the wheel without it. __eot__ My horse doesn't work.
Don Moxica -- we all have to work. __eot__ You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery! __eot__ Savagery is what monkeys understand. __eot__ You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say? __eot__ You will regret this.
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us... __eot__ God be with us admiral.
Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago... __eot__ And what do you think Mendez? __eot__ Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before. __eot__ Come over here.
What do you read? __eot__ Twenty eight.
What's he doing? __eot__ He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus. __eot__ We can't be.
Where can I meet this man? __eot__ Immediately.
You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues! __eot__ Six days ago, yes. __eot__ You must be mad...! __eot__ We have to keep the hopes of these men alive! __eot__ We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon! __eot__ You think I don't know that? __eot__ We're lost! __eot__ The land is there.  I know it! __eot__ You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back! __eot__ And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that! __eot__ Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you! __eot__ You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember? __eot__ You bloody... __eot__ Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that! __eot__ You tell that to them! __eot__ You're right.  Let the men decide.
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez? __eot__ Yes, Your Majesty.
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted. __eot__ Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
... Into a monk... __eot__ Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty. __eot__ We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility... __eot__ Is this true, Brother Buyl?
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez? __eot__ He must be replaced. __eot__ And who would you think of, for such a task?
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence. __eot__ Then why? __eot__ Because he is not afraid of me.
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane. __eot__ I'm not your lawyer until I see the money. __eot__ Here.  I have your money.
Oh no!  No!  Shit! __eot__ Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for? __eot__ He has the camera!  He took the movie!
Don't say anything. __eot__ Where are we going? __eot__ I'm coming with you. __eot__ Yes.  Yes, come with me! __eot__ I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check. __eot__ You bring the cigarettes? __eot__ Oh, sure.
...delusions and paranoia. __eot__ I was all of these. __eot__ Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that. __eot__ What about Oleg? __eot__ Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia. __eot__ No, he is here.  Shit... __eot__ Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself. __eot__ What about my movie rights?  Book rights? __eot__ Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing. __eot__ What's your cut?  How much? __eot__ I would say...half.  Half is fair. __eot__ No.  No way. __eot__ But it's... __eot__ Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no. __eot__ This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me. __eot__ What else do you need? __eot__ I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here. __eot__ Give me another one, please.
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like. __eot__ My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind. __eot__ Your mother was blind? __eot__ Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me. __eot__ Back in the Czech Republic? __eot__ Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness... __eot__ Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness? __eot__ Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me. __eot__ Your father put cigarettes out on you? __eot__ Out on my back when I was a small boy. __eot__ Can I see your back?
I'm abused.  Don't you think? __eot__ I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital... __eot__ Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him. __eot__ Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide. __eot__ Yes, but he was a cop.
Now I become custody of police department? __eot__ If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation. __eot__ I will if they don't send me back. __eot__ They won't until this is over.
Are you married? __eot__ Divorced. __eot__ Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
I can't take you to my place. __eot__ Somewhere else?
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires. __eot__ So...the station is empty? __eot__ Yeah.  This way.
You considered becoming a prostitute? __eot__ Yes, I considered it. __eot__ Did you ever turn tricks before? __eot__ No. __eot__ What about back home? __eot__ No.
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's. __eot__ So you were never a prostitute? __eot__ What are you asking me? __eot__ I'm just trying to find out who you are.
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore. __eot__ I know. __eot__ You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison? __eot__ They're not gonna send you right back. __eot__ I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...
Are you alright? __eot__ I still can't believe Eddie's gone. __eot__ I'm sorry.
Is he your boyfriend? __eot__ Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous? __eot__ If I was your boyfriend, I might be. __eot__ If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one. __eot__ No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you. __eot__ I'm glad I met you.
You better get packed. __eot__ Right.
Do you have coffee? __eot__ In the kitchen. __eot__ I'll make some for us. __eot__ I'll get my clothes.
What are you doing? __eot__ Pouring it out!
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own. __eot__ ...Do you really want me to forget about you? __eot__ I don't want to drag you down with me. __eot__ Daphne, I...
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything. __eot__ C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people? __eot__ Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs. __eot__ Go on.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you. __eot__ If I tell you, will you arrest me? __eot__ Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you. __eot__ No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
A cop? __eot__ I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled. __eot__ Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth? __eot__ You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
Oh. __eot__ It was my decision, not his. __eot__ Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions. __eot__ Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours. __eot__ Oh yeah...?  Alright. __eot__ I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us. __eot__ Yeah, sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
Who did cause and origin? __eot__ Who do you think, Chief?! __eot__ Then why didn't you talk to the reporter? __eot__ 'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here? __eot__ I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up. __eot__ What do you mean, 'cleaned up?' __eot__ I let her take a shower. __eot__ A shower!?  Did you take one, too? __eot__ No!  Nothing happened. __eot__ Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
Chief - mind if I take her? __eot__ Okay.  But not water sports.
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King! __eot__ What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot. __eot__ Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?! __eot__ Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian. __eot__ Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine. __eot__ End my career? __eot__ How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield. __eot__ But Chief?  Over this?? __eot__ There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial.
Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime. __eot__ Yeah, right. __eot__ What was that, Korfin? __eot__ I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media. __eot__ You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition? __eot__ Yeah.  He finished awhile ago. __eot__ Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that? __eot__ Yeah.
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down. __eot__ Vodka tonic. __eot__ Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid. __eot__ What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
I'm gonna propose. __eot__ When? __eot__ Tomorrow.  At lunch. __eot__ You ready?
What's he looking for? __eot__ A timer.
Where is she? __eot__ Takin' a bath. __eot__ Any I.D.? __eot__ Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
Sorry...PD only. __eot__ It's okay.
Only one guys checked in? __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side. __eot__ Stay with her.
Are you hit? __eot__ No.  I'm okay.
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time! __eot__ I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
Who's there? __eot__ Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions. __eot__ I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney... __eot__ Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
What's wrong? __eot__ We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel. __eot__ Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl... __eot__ Do you have any Czech girls working for you? __eot__ No. __eot__ Did you tell him you did?
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden. __eot__ What are you saying? __eot__ Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me about her, too.
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here. __eot__ Describe him. __eot__ Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me. __eot__ He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly! __eot__ She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do. __eot__ No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
You know what that is, right? __eot__ No, what is it? __eot__ Why don't you explain it, Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor?
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want. __eot__ Watch the news? __eot__ Nah, I musta missed it. __eot__ Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit. __eot__ Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff. __eot__ Nah, why should you? __eot__ I don't even watch TV. __eot__ Good.  Good.  Commendable.
Did you get a report from the M.E.? __eot__ Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me? __eot__ If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report? __eot__ You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here. __eot__ Pretty. __eot__ Hmmmm. __eot__ Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile. __eot__ Who says she's a suspect?
What would you call her? __eot__ Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell. __eot__ Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary? __eot__ Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally.
I'll come with you. __eot__ There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do. __eot__ I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something. __eot__ This isn't homicide school. __eot__ My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle. __eot__ You're Polish? __eot__ My folks are. __eot__ Stay here.
You goin' to the escort service? __eot__ You got any better ideas? __eot__ Mind if I ride along with you? __eot__ This has nothing to do with your fire. __eot__ But what if it does?  You might need my help.
I'll let you know what happens. __eot__ This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over. __eot__ Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come. __eot__ I'll call it... tails.
Two heads. __eot__ Better than one.
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's. __eot__ I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
You thirsty? __eot__ I'm on duty. __eot__ So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back. __eot__ Of course. __eot__ Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about? __eot__ I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid. __eot__ Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid __eot__ She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her. __eot__ Is that all there is?
Why not? __eot__ Something back home?
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true. __eot__ Raw deal.
Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her. __eot__ You wanna talk to her alone? __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ What would your girlfriend think of that? __eot__ I don't have a girlfriend. __eot__ My point exactly. __eot__ I'm serious here. __eot__ So am I. __eot__ C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently. __eot__ You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building? __eot__ You know what I'm saying here.
Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left. __eot__ Hey.  I'm a professional. __eot__ Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her. __eot__ Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me. __eot__ I took her there for a shower and that's it. __eot__ Just a shower?
Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but... __eot__ No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead. __eot__ I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent. __eot__ Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional. __eot__ But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her. __eot__ How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that? __eot__ You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
So...who's Nicky? __eot__ What do you want? __eot__ Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books. __eot__ What's your accomplishment. __eot__ I kill someone famous. __eot__ Then do it, asshole. __eot__ Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time. __eot__ If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you? __eot__ Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
Detective, does it look like a murder? __eot__ We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done. __eot__ How many victims are up there? __eot__ There are two bodies found at this point. __eot__ Can we go up to the crime scene? __eot__ You know you can't do that.  C'mon. __eot__ Is it drug related? __eot__ We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
Detective - can you tell us what happened here? __eot__ I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department? __eot__ I really can't give out any information right now at this point. __eot__ Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct? __eot__ He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine. __eot__ Do you have the suspect in custody? __eot__ Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously. __eot__ Alright, cut, cut, cut.
Eddie, are you okay? __eot__ Yeah.  Now's not a good time. __eot__ Alright. __eot__ Alright? __eot__ Alright. __eot__ Alright. __eot__ Okay.
Hey, honey. __eot__ Hey.
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement. __eot__ I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you! __eot__ You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something. __eot__ Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh... __eot__ Stop it. __eot__ Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out? __eot__ Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me. __eot__ I'm not. __eot__ Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something. __eot__ Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was... __eot__ That was good.  You were holding the evidence. __eot__ You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not. __eot__ Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh? __eot__ You're ruthless. __eot__ You're not so bad yourself.
Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it? __eot__ Could be Leon's. __eot__ Jesus.  And last week you came over with blood on your shoes.  What am I going to do with you?
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it. __eot__ Answer the phone. __eot__ No.  Tell me what you want to say. __eot__ Answer it. __eot__ Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for a second.  They only call me when it's an emergency.  Just hold that thought.  Can you call back?
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight! __eot__ That's good. __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ Well, that's great. __eot__ Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here. __eot__ No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great. __eot__ No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and... __eot__ I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk. __eot__ Promise? __eot__ I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me. __eot__ Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me. __eot__ Patronizing you... Nay, I love you. __eot__ I love you.
Okay, til tonight. __eot__ Tonight. __eot__ You promise? __eot__ Yeah.  I promise. __eot__ Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing. __eot__ Yeah, yeah.  Good thing. __eot__ Okay. __eot__ See you later.  Good luck. __eot__ Thank you. __eot__ Don't be late.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off. __eot__ Jesus Christ.
Sooner or later that's everybody. __eot__ Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore. __eot__ I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie. __eot__ I'm not moody.
How old are your kids? __eot__ My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?
So what's unique? __eot__ Not what.  Who.
He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle. __eot__ That's unique. __eot__ Yeah.  And he still went to the party.
I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me. __eot__ You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
Ready? __eot__ Keep them out of my way. __eot__ Okay.  You ready? __eot__ Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
Any chance we can do that again? __eot__ Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do? __eot__ I am butcher. __eot__ You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for? __eot__ You stuff sausage in it. __eot__ And what do you do with the bones? __eot__ Dog food.
Are you married? __eot__ No.  Are you proposing?
Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film. __eot__ Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you. __eot__ No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you. __eot__ I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me. __eot__ We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars. __eot__ What?  It doesn't work that way. __eot__ If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it. __eot__ Wait a minute.  Wait a minute. __eot__ Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk about surrendering.
Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment? __eot__ My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend. __eot__ Tommy, take a walk.
You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life. __eot__ You'll be my first.
C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh, look, you're sweating.  You don't have the balls. __eot__ Get down on your knees.
Where's your partner? __eot__ The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
Tell him to put his gun down! __eot__ Let her go!  Let her go!! __eot__ If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
Hi, I'm Honey. __eot__ Where's Czech girl? __eot__ Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl.
Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser. __eot__ I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her?
It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed? __eot__ Where is escort service? __eot__ That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser? __eot__ I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address? __eot__ Look.  Do we have a problem here? There's no reason to have a problem. I'm gonna make you feel real good.  You wanna Czech girl? After I'm done with you, you won't miss her.  Now why don't you pay me?
Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go. __eot__ Look, man, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time.
Give me the address!! __eot__ Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
Next.  Could I see your documents, please? __eot__ Yes sir.
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States? __eot__ Two weeks holiday. __eot__ How much money are you carrying with you? __eot__ I have five-hundred dollars. __eot__ Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!
Is he with you?  Are you travelling together? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Please join us.  Come on forward. __eot__ Is there a problem? __eot__ No, you're travelling together.  I want to talk to you together.  Hi, how are you?  Can I take a look at your documents?  Are you related?
We are both from Prague. __eot__ How long are you planning to stay? __eot__ Two weeks. __eot__ I'd like to speak for himself, okay? __eot__ He doesn't speak English.
Who is he? __eot__ New York's finest.  This is his case.
This all you want? __eot__ Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights? __eot__ In here, says he wants a million. __eot__ Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview? __eot__ Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not? __eot__ Yes.  Both.
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth. __eot__ Okay.
Don't fool around. __eot__ Okay.
Did you hear what I said? __eot__ I want to document my trip to America.
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies! __eot__ Don't speak Russian! __eot__ Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech? __eot__ Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision. __eot__ We have no money.  Come on.
Turn that off!  Get the bags. __eot__ Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog. __eot__ For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so.  Unless you refuse, Oleg.
What? __eot__ Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
Turn that fucking thing off! __eot__ I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
Speak English! __eot__ You said speak Czech! __eot__ How you erase this? __eot__ I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
Whore? __eot__ I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
Get in the bathroom! __eot__ Whatever we do - we fuck her, right? __eot__ Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN. __eot__ Shut up. __eot__ Does it hurt?
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that! __eot__ Don't want to film this?
What is it? __eot__ The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it. __eot__ I did. __eot__ And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry. __eot__ Why not? __eot__ Put the camera down, Oleg.
What is that? __eot__ What does it look like?  It's an address book!
Let me get a shot of it. __eot__ Sit down! __eot__ This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.
No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous! __eot__ Good idea!
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera! __eot__ Cut!
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we? __eot__ Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me? __eot__ The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
I'm serious. __eot__ Shut up.  Look!
This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!' __eot__ Bad last moment - I cut it out.
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape! __eot__ Be quiet.  Watch.
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director? __eot__ Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now. __eot__ Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit. __eot__ Credit? __eot__ Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul. __eot__ Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
You got that? __eot__ No, I don't get that! __eot__ You think you are a director?  You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate you.
Traitor!! __eot__ No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
Emil???! __eot__ Surprise!  Surprise!
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding. __eot__ Did you hurt her? __eot__ You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!! __eot__ Milos.  Get my money!
We spent it! __eot__ Ha. Ha. __eot__ Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?!
I can get you a job. __eot__ A job? __eot__ Yes, the money is good. __eot__ As a plumber?! __eot__ It's easy to learn. __eot__ A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work! __eot__ We started over, you can too. __eot__ You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?
Robert...? __eot__ What are you doing here? __eot__ You've got a call. __eot__ I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey. __eot__ Trust me, you'll want to take this call.
Viewer discretion advised! __eot__ You want the tape?  There it is!
Isn't he a little moody? __eot__ Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love. __eot__ In love?  With who?
Yeah? __eot__ Paulie, you've got kids, right?
And you, you'll pay for what you did! __eot__ This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself. __eot__ If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend! __eot__ Don't give me that fucking shit.
I know. __eot__ What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me? __eot__ Well, he... __eot__ I want to hear everything he said. __eot__ I'm trying to tell you. __eot__ Alright.  Go ahead. __eot__ That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage. __eot__ Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
Yes...he's my friend. __eot__ Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
I speak English. __eot__ Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here? __eot__ New York. __eot__ Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York? __eot__ A cheap hotel. __eot__ What are you coming here to do? __eot__ I'm here for movies. __eot__ Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies? __eot__ Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white. __eot__ Excuse me?
No.  Go ahead. __eot__ Thanks.  Appreciate it.
So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up? __eot__ That's what it looks like to me. __eot__ And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them. __eot__ Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
What was that? __eot__ Evidence.  Of a homicide.
I'll take him. __eot__ No way!  He's mine! __eot__ We're takin' him.  Don't argue! __eot__ He's my collar! __eot__ Well, he killed my partner! __eot__ He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty? __eot__ Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!! __eot__ Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy? __eot__ Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns. __eot__ Oh yeah?  Guess again.
I'll send a cop back for you. __eot__ Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
You okay? __eot__ A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights! __eot__ Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here.
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter. __eot__ Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not? __eot__ How did you start the fire this time? __eot__ I used an accelerant. __eot__ Yeah?  What kind? __eot__ Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity! __eot__ I heard.  Who the hell let them up there? __eot__ I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph? __eot__ You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious? __eot__ Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here. __eot__ Oh yeah, why? __eot__ 'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie. __eot__ Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
Mouth's clean, too. __eot__ Clean? __eot__ Don't blow your nose!
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run. __eot__ But you knew that, right?
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it. __eot__ He knew all along. __eot__ What?? __eot__ That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
What? __eot__ There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him. __eot__ Yeah? __eot__ Maybe you can be his stand-in.
-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is. __eot__ How long they been livin' here? __eot__ You hear that question, Garcia?
You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene. __eot__ Aren't you tired? __eot__ If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?! __eot__ It hurts.  Aw, Jesus! __eot__ Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby.
How was it? __eot__ Not good.
Get outta here! __eot__ What the hell happened? __eot__ They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!
Room was registered to a Francis Capra. __eot__ Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian? __eot__ The clerk?
What are you gonna do? __eot__ Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off. __eot__ Don't stoop to his level!
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy. __eot__ Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood. __eot__ GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!
This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor. __eot__ Your doctor? __eot__ Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication. __eot__ ...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people? __eot__ It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor. __eot__ You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial. __eot__ Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted. __eot__ Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist? __eot__ Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move? __eot__ And isn't there a movie in the works about you? __eot__ We're in negotiations, that's correct. __eot__ But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes? __eot__ That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I wasn't convicted.
SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE __eot__ Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
CONTINUED __eot__ I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
CONTINUED __eot__ She's wonderful.
CONTINUED __eot__ Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
CONTINUED __eot__ How did they manage to do that without any communication?
CONTINUED __eot__ I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
CONTINUED __eot__ We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
Hi. Frank... coming in, please. __eot__ Right. Just a sec. __eot__ Okay. __eot__ Okay, come on down.
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something. __eot__ Sure, what is it? __eot__ Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying. __eot__ What's up? __eot__ It's about my salary cheques. __eot__ Yes? __eot__ Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18. __eot__ Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem. __eot__ Really. __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices. __eot__ It's possible. __eot__ Well, what do you think we ought to do about it? __eot__ I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out. __eot__ I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training. __eot__ No. I never did, either.
I suppose the idea was specialized training. __eot__ I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation. __eot__ Oh? __eot__ Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out. __eot__ No, as a matter of fact, I didn't. __eot__ Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told. __eot__ That seems very unlikely. __eot__ Yes, I thought so. __eot__ Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now. __eot__ How? __eot__ Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal. __eot__ That's true.
Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training. __eot__ Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us. __eot__ I know. It would be almost inconceivable. __eot__ But not completely inconceivable? __eot__ I suppose it isn't logically impossible. __eot__ I guess it isn't. __eot__ Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
Well, that's something. __eot__ Yes, I don't know what to make of it. __eot__ I suppose computers have been known to be wrong. __eot__ Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low. __eot__ Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
Good morning. How's it going? __eot__ Are you reasonably awake? __eot__ Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up? __eot__ Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again. __eot__ You're kidding. __eot__ No.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure. __eot__ Two units in four days. How many spares do we have? __eot__ Two more. __eot__ Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
Hal? __eot__ Yes.
It's the last one. __eot__ Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them. __eot__ I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy. __eot__ I guess not. __eot__ I think I'll have to go out and burn them off. __eot__ Roger.
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know. __eot__ He's got a point.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem. __eot__ What is it, Hal? __eot__ MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours. __eot__ I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something. __eot__ Sure, Dave, what's up? __eot__ You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition? __eot__ Yes, I know. __eot__ You probably also know that we found them okay. __eot__ Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong. __eot__ Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem? __eot__ Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear. __eot__ Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history. __eot__ I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal. __eot__ Well, don't worry about it. __eot__ And don't you worry about it. __eot__ Is your confidence in me fully restored? __eot__ Yes, it is, Hal. __eot__ Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
Too bad about Frank, isn't it? __eot__ Yes, it is. __eot__ I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months. __eot__ The antenna has to be replaced. __eot__ Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation. __eot__ It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please. __eot__ I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble. __eot__ I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please. __eot__ Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me. __eot__ Hal, switch to manual hibernation control. __eot__ I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest. __eot__ Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control. __eot__ I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it. __eot__ Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
I am prepared to do that anyway. __eot__ I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission. __eot__ Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.
CONTINUED __eot__ Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
CONTINUED __eot__ Did they have any explanation for this?
CONTINUED __eot__ Well, what is it?
CONINUED __eot__ Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
CONTINUED __eot__ Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
CONTINUED __eot__ Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you? __eot__ I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
I'm having a party tomorrow. __eot__ Yes, I know that sweetheart. __eot__ Are you coming to my party? __eot__ No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days. __eot__ When are you coming home? __eot__ In three days, darling, I hope.
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy? __eot__ Mommy's out to the hair- dresser. __eot__ Where is Mrs. Brown? __eot__ She's in the bathroom. __eot__ Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called. __eot__ How many days until you come home? __eot__ Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow. __eot__ Thank you, Daddy. __eot__ I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling? __eot__ Yes, Daddy. __eot__ 'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart. __eot__ Goodbye, Daddy.
Oh, thank you very much. __eot__ Thank you. __eot__ Well, how's it going back there?
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic. __eot__ I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later. __eot__ Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight. __eot__ Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week. __eot__ I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty. __eot__ I'll bet it's a fortune.
And your charming little daughter? __eot__ Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow. __eot__ Oh, that's such a delightful age. __eot__ How is gregor? __eot__ He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days. __eot__ Well, where are all of you off to?
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal. __eot__ Well, that does sound very odd.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink? __eot__ No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going. __eot__ Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you. __eot__ Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
How do you do, Mr. Miller? __eot__ I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding. __eot__ Please, it really doesn't matter. __eot__ Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight? __eot__ Yes, very pleasant. __eot__ Well, shall we go through Documentation? __eot__ Fine.
Yes, I think so. Just about then. __eot__ I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking. __eot__ Yes, it's coming along very well.
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off. __eot__ Are you quite sure? __eot__ Yes, really, thank you very much.
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon __eot__ Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius? __eot__ Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean. __eot__ Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius. __eot__ Really? __eot__ Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days. __eot__ You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days? __eot__ That's right. __eot__ I see.
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention. __eot__ Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely. __eot__ Fortunately, they did. __eot__ Well, I'm glad about that.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question? __eot__ Certainly. __eot__ Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts. __eot__ Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps? __eot__ I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago. __eot__ How can you tell it was deliberately buried? __eot__ By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill. __eot__ Any clue as to what it is? __eot__ Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
But you don't have any idea as to what it is? __eot__ Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
Any ideas about the colour? __eot__ Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device? __eot__ Has it been exposed to any sun before now? __eot__ I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days. __eot__ There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest. __eot__ When do we arrive at Clavius? __eot__ We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you? __eot__ Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
Thank you. __eot__ Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements? __eot__ What do you mean? __eot__ Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty. __eot__ I see. __eot__ I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her. __eot__ I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm. __eot__ Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already.
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking? __eot__ No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern. __eot__ Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false. __eot__ I will if I can, Frank. __eot__ Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false? __eot__ True. __eot__ Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true? __eot__ That's true.
That's true. __eot__ Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true? __eot__ That's true __eot__ There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true? __eot__ That's true. __eot__ Thank you very much, Hal.
Hal, have pod arms secure the component. __eot__ Roger.
Five by five, Frank. __eot__ Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit. __eot__ I understand. __eot__ Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition. __eot__ Roger. __eot__ Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors. __eot__ Opening pod bay doors.
Yes, Hal, what's up? __eot__ It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure. __eot__ Let me see the tracking alignment display.
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault? __eot__ Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure. __eot__ All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
Yeah? __eot__ I want to pick up my car.
Name? __eot__ Hammond.
This is three years old. __eot__ Yeah, I've been busy.
We don't wash 'em, ya know. __eot__ How about chargin' the battery? __eot__ That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it. __eot__ Great, just great.
Yeah. __eot__ Vodka. __eot__ Maybe you better have a Black Russian. __eot__ No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Now how's your memory doin'? __eot__ Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about. __eot__ Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think. __eot__ I don't give a shit who you ask.
I don't give a damn about his girl... __eot__ Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know. __eot__ Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto. __eot__ You got a real big mouth, convict.
I want to drive awhile. __eot__ I ain't tired yet. __eot__ Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls. __eot__ Whaddya mean, buy? __eot__ Pros.
Pay money? __eot__ Yeah, dummy.  Money. __eot__ I never paid for it in my life. __eot__ It's better when you pay... they let you do anything. __eot__ They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life. __eot__ Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat. __eot__ He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
Hey, what about me? __eot__ And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
I'm candy... __eot__ Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested? __eot__ Hey, what kind of talk is that? __eot__ Oh ... You're a schoolteacher... __eot__ No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'. __eot__ Goodbye.
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on? __eot__ Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
You're in a hurry. __eot__ Yeah, i been waiting three years. __eot__ You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'? __eot__ No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there... __eot__ What's the matter with my place? __eot__ No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
Well, maybe I'll see you later ... __eot__ Here's hoping, baby...
Hello, again. __eot__ I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
Here you go, baby. __eot__ Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember? __eot__ Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but I got to go.  I got this cop waitin' for me...
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay? __eot__ Now you're talkin'. See ya...
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun. __eot__ Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
How about it? __eot__ I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...
I hear you've got visitors. __eot__ Would you guys... __eot__ No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls... __eot__ Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be... __eot__ You're gonna help us take him. __eot__ No chance. __eot__ He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it.  Otherwise, he gets ventilated.
Where's ganz? __eot__ In the back.  Down the other corridor.
You lying son of a bitch... __eot__ What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever... __eot__ I don't think you're gonna make it. __eot__ Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot. __eot__ You're done.  End of story. __eot__ I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
You got a name, cop? __eot__ Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay? __eot__ Sure, anything you want.
You here to write my life story? __eot__ Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
Yeah, I noticed... __eot__ Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street. __eot__ Didn't work out that way.  He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.
Yeah? __eot__ I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first. __eot__ You're crazy. __eot__ I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here. __eot__ What's the big deal about you bein' on the street? __eot__ I got a lot to protect. __eot__ Bullshit. __eot__ It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz. __eot__ I'll think about it.
This prison gives out $400 suits? __eot__ What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.
We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers... __eot__ Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of... __eot__ You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal. __eot__ You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass. __eot__ No way to start a partnership. __eot__ Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met. __eot__ Shit.  I'm already sorry.
Yeah. __eot__ It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'? __eot__ Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away. __eot__ Luther was part of the gang? __eot__ What gang you talkin' about, Jack? __eot__ I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack. __eot__ Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name. __eot__ Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead.... __eot__ I may call you worse than that.
Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company. __eot__ Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me? __eot__ Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me. __eot__ I'm helpin' you, huh?
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man. __eot__ I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun. __eot__ I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me. __eot__ Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
Hey, this works pretty good. __eot__ Thank you. __eot__ Want to try it again?
What do you think? __eot__ I think you better put him on ice, man. __eot__ He's gotta take that call ... if there is one. __eot__ If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor. __eot__ Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up. __eot__ Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning. __eot__ Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl. __eot__ We eat when I say we eat. __eot__ Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music... __eot__ Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat. __eot__ Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station? __eot__ Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you? __eot__ She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
Now, where we goin', convict? __eot__ Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
I don't give out the details. __eot__ Last night, two nights ago, three?
Last night. __eot__ You have a good time?
Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning. __eot__ At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
Well? __eot__ It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it. __eot__ This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece... __eot__ Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that? __eot__ If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up... __eot__ But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats... __eot__ Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge... __eot__ You need five years training to handle a joint like...
Hey, you wanna bet? __eot__ I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with. __eot__ If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid... __eot__ Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway. __eot__ That's never been one of my problems.
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once. __eot__ What are you talkin' about? __eot__ You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it. __eot__ I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed. __eot__ The bet's off.
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge. __eot__ I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers. __eot__ My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control. __eot__ Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
You made that move, huh? __eot__ While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
There. __eot__ Must be billy's girl. __eot__ Come on.
Let's go. __eot__ Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you. __eot__ You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself. __eot__ You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'... __eot__ I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night. __eot__ Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...
Maybe I don't like the way you ask. __eot__ Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
Yeah, right.  You want to try again? __eot__ Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time. __eot__ They saved your ass, convict. __eot__ One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
I been waiting a long time for some money. __eot__ How much? __eot__ Half a million. __eot__ Jesus.
Just tell me about the money. __eot__ Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun. __eot__ He's after your money. __eot__ You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
We split 50-50? __eot__ Not likely, convict. __eot__ You gonna let me keep any of it? __eot__ Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
Where's the money? __eot__ In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
Right, partner. __eot__ Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met. __eot__ Yeah.  Right.
Where's the goddamn car? __eot__ You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked. __eot__ ...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone. __eot__ You just drove by it.
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing. __eot__ I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack. __eot__ Shit.
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time. __eot__ Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit. __eot__ Guess what?  Luther just got in line.
What? __eot__ Musta got some primo bondsman. __eot__ Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash? __eot__ Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs. __eot__ I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed. __eot__ Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world. __eot__ If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town. __eot__ I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl. __eot__ Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you... __eot__ I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it. __eot__ That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther? __eot__ If they don't tell me what I need to know... __eot__ Doesn't it get... Tiring? __eot__ I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-... __eot__ You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money... __eot__ If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row... __eot__ Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job. __eot__ What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks. __eot__ No class... __eot__ Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills? __eot__ Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
That was in style a couple years back, man. __eot__ Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money. __eot__ You stay with me... __eot__ No way...
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers. __eot__ I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
Where's luther? __eot__ Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy. __eot__ Hello. And goodbye.
What about Luther? __eot__ What about Ganz?
We missed. __eot__ You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call. __eot__ Maybe we should pay Luther a visit. __eot__ Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind. __eot__ So you took the rest of the night off...
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split? __eot__ Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue... __eot__ You sure that's the reason?
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job. __eot__ Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ... __eot__ Yeah. Guess not.
Yeah, I see her. __eot__ I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
That was quick. __eot__ When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go. __eot__ Why? __eot__ Luther's on the move...
Notice something funny about that bus? __eot__ Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
Hey, how'd my car get here? __eot__ I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam. __eot__ Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right. __eot__ I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down. __eot__ Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it. __eot__ Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
It's late, they're closing... __eot__ Don't worry about it.
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him... __eot__ Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
Do I get to kiss her too? __eot__ If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro. __eot__ I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
Hey, there she is... __eot__ Whatever play I maker just back me up. __eot__ If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in. __eot__ Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps... __eot__ Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started. __eot__ Partnership? __eot__ Well, you got to admit we come a long way.
You okay? __eot__ Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second. __eot__ You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick. __eot__ Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand. __eot__ There's nothin' to talk about.
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out. __eot__ And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash? __eot__ That's right. Not my style, Reggie.. __eot__ You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here. __eot__ No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours. __eot__ Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
Thanks. __eot__ No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun. __eot__ Yeah, I read the report...
Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back. __eot__ Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
Yeah... __eot__ Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun? __eot__ Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it. __eot__ You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack. __eot__ Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead... __eot__ Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down. __eot__ You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go. __eot__ Jack? __eot__ Yeah? __eot__ Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one. __eot__ I'll keep it in mind.
What the bell happened? __eot__ I lost them, that's what happened. __eot__ How did they get away? __eot__ They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
Which one pulled the trigger? __eot__ The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away. __eot__ You couldn't get to him?
What a screw-up. __eot__ Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play? __eot__ I didn't have the time. __eot__ Too bad, it would've covered your ass.  Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike.
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with. __eot__ Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
Where the Christ do you think you're going? __eot__ I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
That's what you say, Cates... __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it... __eot__ The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report. __eot__ Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap. __eot__ I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel? __eot__ Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty. __eot__ I'll help you out.
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours. __eot__ Shit.
Billy Bear... __eot__ Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
Who are all these? __eot__ They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago. __eot__ Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this? __eot__ Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
Tell me that's not the same guy. __eot__ Hey ... Dick Tracy.
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them? __eot__ Here's the file. Cates checks the file. __eot__ One of  em's in the slam.
You look awful. __eot__ So do you...been a long day. __eot__ Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you. __eot__ Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong. __eot__ Doesn't look like it. __eot__ Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls? __eot__ Nothing.
Bullshit red tape. __eot__ I'm heading out. How about you?
I got to wait for a call. __eot__ Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him. __eot__ What?
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before? __eot__ I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
A cop... __eot__ I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he? __eot__ Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth. __eot__ You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is. __eot__ Who gives a fuck what you think?
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie. __eot__ I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her. __eot__ I don't know.
He ... he wants me to help him skip town. __eot__ When? How? __eot__ I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
What am I wanted for? __eot__ I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
I don't think your gun's loaded... __eot__ This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky? __eot__ I still don't think it's loaded.
Hey, you're right. __eot__ You're hopeless. __eot__ That's the way I see it, too.
I'm all wet. __eot__ What's wrong with that?
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today. __eot__ What'd you do? __eot__ Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker. __eot__ I guess he got the message... __eot__ Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do... __eot__ Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you. __eot__ Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit? __eot__ I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it. __eot__ If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference. __eot__ Hey, you know what I really think? __eot__ Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it. __eot__ I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning. __eot__ What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
Maybe you ought to buy me one. __eot__ Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning. __eot__ Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead. __eot__ Maybe that makes a nice excuse. __eot__ Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are. __eot__ What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy? __eot__ I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless. __eot__ That's the way I see it, too. __eot__ Call me later. __eot__ You sure you want me to? __eot__ Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
Thanks for the coffee. __eot__ I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge... __eot__ Guess people ought to know who I am...
Great place for lunch. __eot__ Yeah, one of my favorites. __eot__ You made the front page.
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day... __eot__ Jack, are you okay? __eot__ Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun... __eot__ Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ... __eot__ Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function... __eot__ I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit. __eot__ Here it comes again ... the sacred job... __eot__ That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that... __eot__ I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible.... __eot__ Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay? __eot__ This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
I'm at work, asshole.  Where else? __eot__ Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business. __eot__ No wonder you're so popular. __eot__ No, it's I'm just surprised you called. __eot__ So am I.
The number ... what's the Goddamn number? __eot__ Jack?  What was that?
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold... __eot__ Jack, wait... __eot__ Just a second, that's all!
Hello. __eot__ Hi, it's me... __eot__ Fuck you.
Hey, I don't believe it. __eot__ Hiya, kid. __eot__ I ought to have you and your friend thrown out... __eot__ Don't.  We've had a hard night. __eot__ I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened? __eot__ We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
You real down? __eot__ I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.
Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit... __eot__ Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody... __eot__ How do you know? __eot__ Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes? __eot__ Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party. __eot__ It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him. __eot__ So what? __eot__ When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible. __eot__ Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend. __eot__ Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
Whaddya think? __eot__ What do I know?  I'm just a bartender. __eot__ Let's go, Reggie.
How'd they take it back at headquarters? __eot__ Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this. __eot__ I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that. __eot__ Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
Three more hours... __eot__ Where is he? __eot__ Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind... __eot__ Tell me. __eot__ He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
You're impossible... __eot__ That's what I always say.
Who the hell are you? __eot__ Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop. __eot__ Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress... __eot__ Shrink major, not a shrink.
Hard man to live with. __eot__ How would you know? __eot__ Hey, two days with him is enough. __eot__ That's no bull.
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you... __eot__ In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
Hey... __eot__ Shut up. __eot__ What the hell's wrong?  I didn't do anything.
What do you want?  What's goin' on? __eot__ Shut up.
Stall. __eot__ What do you want?
Keep stallin'. __eot__ Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
How hot are they? __eot__ Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
How ya doin'? __eot__ Can't complain. __eot__ We got a lot to talk about. __eot__ Yeah, old times. __eot__ We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay? __eot__ Sure, right.
Surprise, Luther. __eot__ Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up- __eot__ I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid... __eot__ I don't know what you're talkin' about. __eot__ You want that Indian to snap her neck?
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me... __eot__ Don't give me this, we were partners. __eot__ Billy, go ahead, break it... __eot__ No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money. __eot__ When? __eot__ I can't get it until Monday. Honest. __eot__ You chickenshit punk... __eot__ Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
Come on, you can trust me. Please. __eot__ You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
Let her go. __eot__ First, the money.
Rosalie, you okay? __eot__ What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
How you doing, man? __eot__ Not bad, not bad.
You want to go outside? __eot__ Naw, right here's okay.
You sure? __eot__ I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
How about some ammo? __eot__ It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
How much? __eot__ This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used... __eot__ Don't mess with me. How much? __eot__ Five bills. __eot__ Five.  On credit. __eot__ This ain't a credit business.
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it? __eot__ Give it back. __eot__ Try and take it.
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play. __eot__ I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Appipulai Leeloo Minai.. __eot__ Corn-i-Lius? __eot__ At your service.
What're you laughing about? __eot__ Napoleon... small.
The case..with the stones... Where is it? __eot__ San Agamat chay bet... envolet! __eot__ The case was stolen?
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat! __eot__ You know exactly where they are!
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas! __eot__ No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
Akta dedero ansila do mektet. __eot__ I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
...We're saved! __eot__ I'm fucked!
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again __eot__ I remember you now..the so called art dealer. __eot__ I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones? __eot__ ...Why on earth do the stones interest you? __eot__ Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me... __eot__ Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you. __eot__ Why?  What's wrong with me? __eot__ ...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it. __eot__ Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...
...would you like a drink? __eot__ No thank you. __eot__ Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life! __eot__ They are robots!
Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business! __eot__ Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another. __eot__ Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
You are a monster, Zorg! __eot__ I know...
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest. __eot__ Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here. __eot__ That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her? __eot__ She dropped in on me... holding this.
Who are you? __eot__ I brought the girl remember? __eot__ The girl?
He's a she! __eot__ You noticed... __eot__ There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect! __eot__ So you do know her. __eot__ Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
They all like this in your family, father? __eot__ She's an exception.. __eot__ Thank you so much for your help Mr...? __eot__ Dallas. Korben Dallas.
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over! __eot__ I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better? __eot__ She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip. __eot__ I know. I was there when she arrived.
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat? __eot__ It means, "Never without my permission". __eot__ That's what I thought.
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston. __eot__ Is that the usual way priests go on vacation? __eot__ We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission.. __eot__ What kind of mission? __eot__ We have to save the world. __eot__ Good luck.. __eot__ Of course. __eot__ Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
What are you doing? __eot__ Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause. __eot__ Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo. __eot__ Leeloo's in trouble? __eot__ When is she not in trouble? __eot__ Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works? __eot__ Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light. __eot__ Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work. __eot__ And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying? __eot__ That's what I'm saying.
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL. __eot__ One more reason to shoot first eh?
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now! __eot__ Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important. __eot__ That's exactly what we are going to try and do: Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens! General? You may fire when ready.
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions. __eot__ And then? __eot__ And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
Is there anything that can stop it? __eot__ Yes..thank God..
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here? __eot__ White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards. __eot__ Thank you, Mr. President.
What are we going to do? __eot__ This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
It's a miracle!!! __eot__ What is? __eot__ I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
Father, will you please explain what's going on? __eot__ The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being? __eot__ Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
What's she doing? __eot__ Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time.. __eot__ Yes. Of course..
There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names... __eot__ I didn't know your size.
They really made her... __eot__ Perfect.
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel! __eot__ Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
Where's Leeloo? __eot__ On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one. __eot__ It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
You're all safe. Thanks be to God! __eot__ Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you... __eot__ Who? __eot__ The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
Leeloo... is... she's... __eot__ Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them. __eot__ ...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live! __eot__ I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are! __eot__ Do you love her? __eot__ I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time! __eot__ I don't have time... I need to know. __eot__ Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again. __eot__ I would like to have died in peace...
I'm sorry, but... the Stones... __eot__ They are... with me...
Yeah? __eot__ Hey bud! Finger here.
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training. __eot__ I was talking to the cat. __eot__ Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
At least, the cat comes back. __eot__ You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there. __eot__ I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one. __eot__ Don't exist bud.
I just found a picture of you. __eot__ How do I look? __eot__ Like shit.
I don't need one. __eot__ You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive. __eot__ Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!! __eot__ How many points you got left on your license? __eot__ Uh... at least fifty. __eot__ In your dreams! See you tonight!
Hello? __eot__ Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here. __eot__ Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist.. __eot__ So, just how big was this fare? __eot__ 5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect..
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare.. __eot__ Leeloo..
Akina delutan, nou-shan. __eot__ ...'Scuse me?
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan! __eot__ It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
...Priest... __eot__ You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest... __eot__ Vito Cornelius?
Eto Akta Gamat! __eot__ I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
...What's your name? __eot__ Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat. __eot__ Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter? __eot__ ...Leeloo.
The Fifth Element... __eot__ Take them and put them in a safe place.
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place? __eot__ When mankind comes to its senses. We will return. __eot__ Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries! __eot__ Time is of no importance, only life is important.
When EVIL returns so shall we. __eot__ We will be ready, Lord.
...Hello? __eot__ You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City! __eot__ Hi Ma... __eot__ I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
Are you listening to me, you ingrate! __eot__ Yes ma..
Other than that... You all right? __eot__ ...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about? __eot__ I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it? __eot__ All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly..
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two! __eot__ Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me. __eot__ They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!
Yeah? __eot__ Have you pulled yourself together? __eot__ ...Not yet.
Hello? __eot__ You little sleaze bag! __eot__ ...Ma??? __eot__ Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas.. __eot__ How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4... __eot__ I had the worst goddamn nightmare. __eot__ You have nine points left on your license.. __eot__ Thanks for reminding me..
I'm sorry.. __eot__ This is a police control action..
30 seconds... __eot__ Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
6... 5... __eot__ Found it?
...Hi. __eot__ Does it get any better or what!
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service? __eot__ Uh... not really.
I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal? __eot__ Crystal.
My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here! __eot__ I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own. __eot__ Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams... __eot__ I don't think this is a good time... __eot__ ...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose? __eot__ Yeah, very big, a giant. __eot__ I didn't have a dad... never saw him... never even heard him. 50 billion people listen to me every day... and he doesn't hear me...
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it? __eot__ Got it...
Six to the left. One to the right. __eot__ He's on vacation. __eot__ We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think? __eot__ Not without Leeloo.
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here? __eot__ I'll be right back.
You know how to fly this thing? __eot__ It's like a cab isn't it?
I don't even know what I'm looking for! __eot__ Fuck it! Hold tight!
Solid little jobs, aren't they? __eot__ Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
What did you say? What did you do? __eot__ Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing! __eot__ Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!
Is that all? __eot__ Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance. __eot__ What mission? __eot__ To save the world. __eot__ Where have I heard this song before? __eot__ You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'? __eot__ Just one... why me? __eot__ Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission.
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated. __eot__ And the third one? __eot__ You're the only one left alive...
Don't you open your messages? __eot__ I've had enough good news for today __eot__ You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your tickets.
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet? __eot__ Old tricks are the best tricks eh? __eot__ I'm not going. __eot__ Why not? __eot__ One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.
...Shit! __eot__ What is it?
It's my wife. __eot__ I thought you were divorced. __eot__ I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please...
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back. __eot__ Three of us will never fit in there! __eot__ Oh, yes you will...
Apipoulai! __eot__ I suppose that means "Hi" ?
Valo massa... Chacha hamas. __eot__ Uh..you're welcome.
You hear that? __eot__ Cornelius.. __eot__ Oh god!
Dinoine chagantakat! __eot__ Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
Apipoulai! __eot__ Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
Love... __eot__ Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience.. __eot__ What is... Make Love?
Finished what? __eot__ Learning language. __eot__ Which one? __eot__ All 900.
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?! __eot__ Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine! __eot__ I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need. __eot__ Apipoussan! __eot__ Apipoussan? __eot__ Good! Do you know how we say "make love"? __eot__ Uh... __eot__ ...Hoppi-hoppa.
Here we go again... __eot__ You know women normally change five times more than men. __eot__ You get that off the screen? __eot__ Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women. __eot__ You noticed.. __eot__ OK, you can turn around!
Where you going? __eot__ I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad? __eot__ No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate. __eot__ And you can't concentrate with me around?. __eot__ It's difficult.
You're nothing but a... a... __eot__ The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
I'm so very sad. __eot__ Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say? __eot__ Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy... __eot__ I told you not to read all that crap! __eot__ Protect life... Until death.
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work? __eot__ The wind blows... the fire burns... __eot__ I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones. __eot__ ...The rain falls...
It's up to you now, Angel! __eot__ I'm so tired... __eot__ You can sleep tomorrow... come on... __eot__ I want to sleep... forever... __eot__ Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on a vacation afterwards! A real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. Come on! You can do it!
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them! __eot__ You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things... __eot__ ...Like love... __eot__ Exactly. __eot__ But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life. __eot__ Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight! __eot__ Why?... Why would you need me? __eot__ Because...
Tell me... __eot__ I love you...
Not going to open? __eot__ I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news. __eot__ How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure! __eot__ The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife. __eot__ You right that is bad.. but mathematically luck must change! Grandfather say: "It never rain every day." This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!
At least I won lunch. __eot__ Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
The cash man! __eot__ Been here long? __eot__ Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model? __eot__ Uh.. __eot__ You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..
It's not? __eot__ You gotta push the little yellow button...
Thanks.. __eot__ You're welcome..
This is all that survived? __eot__ Actually only one cell survived.. __eot__ Have you identified it? __eot__ It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000. __eot__ Talk English Doc. __eot__ This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered. __eot__ Sounds like a freak of nature to me. __eot__ Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless.. __eot__ Is there any danger? Some kind of virus? __eot__ We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.
...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh? __eot__ Wonderful!
This thing solid? __eot__ An elephant couldn't crack it.
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center. __eot__ It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies. __eot__ And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage? __eot__ The-Stones weren't aboard the ship. __eot__ ...What do you mean?
I want your best man on this! __eot__ Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
They just landed in the desert. __eot__ How much time is left?
Staedert, do you read me? __eot__ I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
Is that better? __eot__ Perfect, Mr. President. __eot__ I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General. __eot__ There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging.. __eot__ What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger! __eot__ Options. __eot__ Wait or act. __eot__ Recommendations. __eot__ My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests. __eot__ Gentlemen?
Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it? __eot__ I'm about to, Mr. President.
Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much.. __eot__ "..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.." __eot__ Amen..
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications. __eot__ Only too well... here you must be parched..
A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous. __eot__ Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
Drink! __eot__ To fame.. salud..
How's that? Can you hear me better now? __eot__ Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert? __eot__ Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone. __eot__ Yes, Sir! __eot__ Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine. __eot__ Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel. __eot__ I'm not at the hotel!
Am I disturbing you? __eot__ No... not at all.  Where are you?
...Not far, now. __eot__ Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg? __eot__ Got it. __eot__ How's our deal coming along? __eot__ Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally! __eot__ ...I can't wait to be among you.
Welcome home. __eot__ Do you know how much I missed you?
What's this... have you been smoking... ? __eot__ Smoking?  I'm not smoking. __eot__ Your clothing reeks of it. __eot__ You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ? __eot__ I'm not accusing you... __eot__ Well, I'm not smoking, okay? __eot__ Okay, I believe you. __eot__ We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
How's the detective business? __eot__ Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there. __eot__ You better not be smoking, that's all I can say. __eot__ Honey, I'm not, please...
I love you. __eot__ I love you.
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend? __eot__ Sure.  I'll call the guy. __eot__ You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it? __eot__ I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday? __eot__ Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.
This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money. __eot__ I understand. __eot__ Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way. __eot__ I know. __eot__ It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation. __eot__ Why the gun? __eot__ I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even wear it.  It's a precaution.  Don't worry about me.
Hello? __eot__ Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully.. __eot__ Tom?  Where have you been... ?
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there... __eot__ What's wrong?  Are you alright? __eot__ I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there __eot__ ... What's going on? __eot__ Just do it, Amy, please, go.
What happened to you? __eot__ I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright? __eot__ What's going on, Tom?  What happened? __eot__ I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me... __eot__ Tom... __eot__ It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone? __eot__ I don't know.  I'm sorry... __eot__ You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this. __eot__ I wanted to call.  I couldn't. __eot__ You couldn't? __eot__ You don't understand... __eot__ No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything! __eot__ I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
You should have. __eot__ Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us. __eot__ Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through... __eot__ I don't know what to say __eot__ You're killing me... __eot__ Don't... __eot__ What was I supposed to think happened to you?! __eot__ Amy...
Who are you calling? __eot__ Mrs. Christian. __eot__ What? __eot__ She's all I've got.  She's the only witness. __eot__ Tom... she's dead.
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper... __eot__ I just talked to her.
What are these? __eot__ Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.
Anything harder? __eot__ There's nothing harder. __eot__ Snuff? __eot__ What you see is what I got, mister. __eot__ You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend. __eot__ There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
What do you want? __eot__ I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop. __eot__ What are you talking about? __eot__ The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop... __eot__ Bullshit. __eot__ I'm telling you... __eot__ Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ? __eot__ Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out! __eot__ There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader. __eot__ Dino... __eot__ Nobody knows anything.
What the fuck... ! __eot__ I promised him to Machine.
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us. __eot__ What can I do for you today?
I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours. __eot__ Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum? __eot__ A fellow investor. __eot__ Hmm.
You said something about money. __eot__ Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
That's five thousand dollars. __eot__ Is it? __eot__ Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations. __eot__ And they are? __eot__ I want to watch you work. __eot__ I'll consider it. __eot__ And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask. __eot__ Machine. __eot__ If it's not him, there's no deal.
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand. __eot__ We can do that. __eot__ Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit?  Very good.
You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind? __eot__ I'd rather you didn't. __eot__ What's the problem? __eot__ I'm camera shy. __eot__ You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture? __eot__ Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars. __eot__ Machine's in? __eot__ He's in.  It will be his pleasure.
Where's that? __eot__ Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
You brought the money? __eot__ Right here.
Excellent. __eot__ Where are the women? __eot__ They should be here any minute.
What are these for? __eot__ Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they? __eot__ Sure.
Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person? __eot__ What are you... ? __eot__ Take out your gun!
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully. __eot__ Look, I don't know what this... __eot__ Shut up, cunt!  Do exactly as I say, or I'll put this arrow through your throat.
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you? __eot__ I remember him.
Friend of yours? __eot__ Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go... __eot__ Can you guess what I'm going to say next? __eot__ He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this... __eot__ Bring the film, or we kill him.
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city... __eot__ How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
Is that him? __eot__ Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max. __eot__ Move it, dirtbag... !
You're a dead man. __eot__ Leave him alone. __eot__ Fuck off.
... sorry... __eot__ First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it? __eot__ You betrayed us.
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles? __eot__ Call me Tom. __eot__ Alright, Tom. __eot__ What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens... __eot__ There are reasons for the way we do things here. __eot__ Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright. __eot__ Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.? __eot__ I figured you share information. __eot__ We do. __eot__ For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive. __eot__ Why don't they come to me? __eot__ This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal. __eot__ I'm not so sure about this. __eot__ They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear. __eot__ I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them. __eot__ Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall. __eot__ Any good? __eot__ It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after. __eot__ You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind? __eot__ It's good what you're doing.
Celebrity Films. __eot__ Eddie. __eot__ Yeah, who's this? __eot__ I know what you did. __eot__ What? __eot__ I know what you did. __eot__ Who is this. __eot__ You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago... __eot__ What the fuck are you.. ? __eot__ You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
What's he talking about? __eot__ One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
I'm gonna kill you. __eot__ Don't bore me with that bullshit. __eot__ How'd you find me here?
Don't ask questions. __eot__ Fuck you!
Starting to recognize a pattern? __eot__ What do you want? __eot__ Who is Machine? __eot__ I don't know... __eot__ I want his name. __eot__ I told you, I don't know. __eot__ I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude. __eot__ What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up. __eot__ Yeah, the fucking lawyer. __eot__ Told him you could get him a snuff film. __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ How much did he pay you? __eot__ Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker. __eot__ That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her? __eot__ It was a lot of fucking money.
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out. __eot__ Something like that. __eot__ What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ? __eot__ What the fuck do you want from me? __eot__ I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her! __eot__ Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it. __eot__ Why? __eot__ Because we're going there.
I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before. __eot__ You enjoy it? __eot__ Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money. __eot__ Tell me what happened. __eot__ What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop... __eot__ Nobody saw you bring her in? __eot__ There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work. __eot__ What did you do with her body? __eot__ Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods. __eot__ Show me.
Keep moving. __eot__ Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing... __eot__ Stop talking. __eot__ You got absolute zero. __eot__ Show me where you buried her. __eot__ I don't know...  ... out there somewhere. __eot__ Where?  Show me where. __eot__ I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.
Do it. __eot__ Don't think I won't. __eot__ Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy? __eot__ Easy enough for you. __eot__ I never killed anyone. __eot__ That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse. __eot__ What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up. __eot__ I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it? __eot__ Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that? __eot__ The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff? __eot__ Look, you cocksucker... __eot__ Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you. __eot__ Fuck you!
Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you. __eot__ I'm listening. __eot__ As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend. __eot__ Of what sort? __eot__ You are a private investigator? __eot__ That's right. __eot__ Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.
You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself. __eot__ Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature. __eot__ So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege. __eot__ That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly. __eot__ Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money. __eot__ I was well compensated. __eot__ That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me? __eot__ Never mind how I found you. __eot__ Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies... __eot__ They're no friends of mine. __eot__ Except, you're willing commit murder with them. __eot__ None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers. __eot__ Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her.
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one... __eot__ Shut up. __eot__ Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered. __eot__ Shut your mouth and drive! __eot__ Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up?  Tell me, because I really want to understand.  Did he jerk off to it?  You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?
You're making me very angry. __eot__ Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film? __eot__ You're asking me why? __eot__ I'm asking.
A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain... __eot__ Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered? __eot__ Isn't it incredibly obvious? __eot__ Enlighten me. __eot__ Because he could.  He did it because he could.  What other reason were you looking for?
You almost went over your limit. __eot__ Fuck you.
Give me the film. __eot__ You'll get it when we get there.
Give me the film. __eot__ Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
He's lying. __eot__ Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
Big date tonight? __eot__ Yeah... guess so. __eot__ Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina? __eot__ Pardon me? __eot__ My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling. __eot__ Well, it's tempting, but no thanks. __eot__ It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one. __eot__ I'll risk it.
Once you pick it up you can't put it down. __eot__ Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
Truman Capote. __eot__ I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is. __eot__ Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts. __eot__ Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
Remember me? __eot__ Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help. __eot__ Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight. __eot__ Good for you.
How long you been working there? __eot__ Three, four years. __eot__ What's your name, if you don't mind me asking? __eot__ Max. __eot__ Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally... __eot__ There's not much illegal. __eot__ Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now. __eot__ You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me. __eot__ I'm not a cop. __eot__ You're a private eye.  Like Shaft. __eot__ Not quite. __eot__ From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here? __eot__ Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money. __eot__ How much? __eot__ How much do you make now? __eot__ Four hundred a week, off the books. __eot__ Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days. __eot__ Sounds good, pops. __eot__ Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start? __eot__ Tomorrow night, I get off at eight. __eot__ See you then.  Oh, and, don't call me "pops."
... Hello... ? __eot__ Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go. __eot__ Interesting theory. __eot__ What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product. __eot__ Child pornography. __eot__ There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one. __eot__ Snuff films. __eot__ I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing. __eot__ What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see? __eot__ First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer.  It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is.
How old are you? __eot__ Twenty-five. __eot__ Where are your parents? __eot__ I don't know, where are yours? __eot__ I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this? __eot__ I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about? __eot__ You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else. __eot__ Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers. __eot__ You're telling me it doesn't get to you? __eot__ You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops? __eot__ What about me? __eot__ I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids? __eot__ A daughter. __eot__ So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this? __eot__ Good question.
Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo. __eot__ A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it? __eot__ His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish. __eot__ Specialty product. __eot__ You're learning. __eot__ Where does he sell it? __eot__ Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money... __eot__ Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a... __eot__ Alright, I get the picture. __eot__ He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art. __eot__ Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand? __eot__ I'm a working stiff, pops. __eot__ Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses. __eot__ You want me to come out there and play private eye? __eot__ Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back. __eot__ See ya.
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious. __eot__ It's their Presidential Suite. __eot__ Great.
Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag? __eot__ It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?
Wha... ? __eot__ Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?
Who is he? __eot__ I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players... __eot__ Who is he, his name? __eot__ Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him.  Machine.
You don't need to be here. __eot__ What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil." __eot__ "Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
What's next? __eot__ I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask. __eot__ Still don't want to tell me what you're doing? __eot__ Nope.
What's this? __eot__ It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
Look... that's awful generous and everything... __eot__ It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.
Mister Welles. You're very prompt. __eot__ I try to be.
Uh huh, pleasure. __eot__ Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles? __eot__ Thank you.
He's odd. __eot__ He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...
I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places. __eot__ I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire. __eot__ You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now. __eot__ My condolences. __eot__ His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma. __eot__ I'll do whatever I can to help.
Pittsburgh? __eot__ Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary. __eot__ He succeeded. __eot__ We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles? __eot__ I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason. __eot__ Just curious.
My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is. __eot__ You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that. __eot__ There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize... __eot__ Do you want to tell me what you found? __eot__ Cash, stock certificates, and this...
It's a film... of a girl being murdered. __eot__ I'm afraid I don't... __eot__ This is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife...  I only watched what I could.
I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police... __eot__ Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film."  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you.
Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects... __eot__ No. __eot__ If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play... __eot__ I'm telling you it's not that. __eot__ I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it. __eot__ Will you watch it and see for yourself? __eot__ Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
You... you need to go to the police. __eot__ I told you I can't, not yet. __eot__ You don't have any other choice. __eot__ No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first... __eot__ It won't work like that. __eot__ Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations... __eot__ You've found missing persons before. __eot__ Nothing remotely like this. __eot__ I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
Okay... __eot__ My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash. __eot__ I'm not positive this means anything. __eot__ The checks were for odd amounts...
One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents... __eot__ Okay, I follow you so far... __eot__ Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars. __eot__ You're joking. __eot__ To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash.
Hello... ? __eot__ I'm here. __eot__ Do you think the film could have cost that much? __eot__ For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box. __eot__ Okay. __eot__ Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself? __eot__ You told me to look, so I looked. __eot__ You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
Hello? __eot__ Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here. __eot__ How are you?  Having any luck? __eot__ I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright? __eot__ I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment. __eot__ I hope it's nothing serious. __eot__ Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me? __eot__ I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update. __eot__ Fine...
I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve. __eot__ How will I get it to you? __eot__ If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it.
Yes... ? __eot__ Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter. __eot__ I don't understand, who are... ? __eot__ I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before? __eot__ Yes, but... __eot__ These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations...  ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different.  I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere... __eot__ Neil... Neil Cole. __eot__ Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call? __eot__ No. __eot__ Well, I'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24, 1976.  Missing June 11th, 1992.  A runaway, that's how she's listed. Is this information correct... ?
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope. __eot__ They hired you.  You're like, a private detective? __eot__ That's exactly what I am.
I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV. __eot__ You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left? __eot__ No. __eot__ She just seemed... depressed... ? __eot__ She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes. __eot__ What was she running from? __eot__ I don't know. __eot__ If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared. __eot__ We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend... __eot__ Why do you think he did it? __eot__ It got to be too much for him. __eot__ You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse? __eot__ There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left... __eot__ I didn't mean to... __eot__ You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either. __eot__ I had to ask.  I apologize. __eot__ No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now? __eot__ Of course.
I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow... __eot__ Okay.
Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church. __eot__ We're all like that. __eot__ Are you religious? __eot__ No. __eot__ You should be.
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though. __eot__ What? __eot__ It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye. __eot__ There wasn't one.  The police looked. __eot__ Do you think the police did a good job? __eot__ I don't know.  I think so. __eot__ It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something... __eot__ No.  You don't have any reason to think that... __eot__ If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.
How... how can you say that to me...? __eot__ Will you let me look? __eot__ My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me... __eot__ You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?
You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry? __eot__ Yes.
I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her. __eot__ It's been six years. __eot__ What am I supposed to do?  Forget her?  Time heals all wounds, right?  She's all I think about, and I've learned to live with that.  But, you want the truth... the real truth? If I had a choice... if I had to choose, between her being out there, living a good life and being happy, and me not knowing; never finding out what happened to her...  ... or her being dead and me knowing...  I'd choose to know.
Hello... ? __eot__ Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter... __eot__ I remember.  You just left... __eot__ I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
What are you talking about... ? __eot__ She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress... __eot__ What... ?
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead. __eot__ Who is this... ? __eot__ Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her... __eot__ Who are you? __eot__ They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her... __eot__ No... __eot__ He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes... __eot__ No... no... no... __eot__ They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her... __eot__ Why... why are you doing this to me... ? __eot__ They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm sorry.  It happened a month after she ran away.  She's been dead all this time...
Yes... I remember Mary __eot__ You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure... __eot__ Yes.  I remember her.
Do you know what happened to her? __eot__ I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
What is this? __eot__ Those are her belongings. __eot__ Her belongings? __eot__ That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time? __eot__ She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate? __eot__ I'll do what I can.
Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize... __eot__ None too discreet, is he? __eot__ No, sir, he is not. __eot__ He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all... __eot__ Yes, Mister Welles, thank you. __eot__ Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever be of further assistance.
Okay, I'll take it all. __eot__ Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express. __eot__ Cash.
Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first? __eot__ No, you may not. __eot__ Okay.  Fine.
I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of... __eot__ Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you. __eot__ Certainly, sir.
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose? __eot__ What? __eot__ The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it. __eot__ I don't want to.
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you. __eot__ But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that. __eot__ Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
Rick...I can't. __eot__ Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
Alice, you think you can leave? __eot__ What's wrong? __eot__ Kincaid and Joey died last night. __eot__ What?
You alright? __eot__ Kristen...
I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one? __eot__ It was bad. __eot__ Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore? __eot__ I can't find him.
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's. __eot__ It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake. __eot__ Yeah, or turn you into toast.
I can't go back to sleep again. __eot__ I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
We'll figure it out. __eot__ Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me. __eot__ Then we'll stay up together.
Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you. __eot__ Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere. __eot__ I'm sure they're around. __eot__ Yeah, I'm not so sure.
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad. __eot__ You could do worse.
My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master? __eot__ Sounds like a game show host to me. __eot__ No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up. __eot__ Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control. __eot__ How'd you learn so much about dreams? __eot__ When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
You what? __eot__ When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.
Kristen, what happened? __eot__ You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
You in a hurry? __eot__ I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test. __eot__ I know.  I hardly have any time to study. __eot__ Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life. __eot__ I know.
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet. __eot__ We have matching luggage. __eot__ What?
You've been up all night? __eot__ That obvious, huh? __eot__ Then you saw him, too? __eot__ Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
No... __eot__ You're his sister, right? __eot__ Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well. __eot__ Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan. __eot__ I know.  Uh...Alice.
I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed. __eot__ It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful... __eot__ "In her dream"?
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead! __eot__ Kristen's story really got to her.
I've been working double shifts. __eot__ Extra money, huh? __eot__ Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow. __eot__ The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
How long have you been awake? __eot__ Three days.
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you? __eot__ Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
Not really. __eot__ Is there something we can do? __eot__ I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.
You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him. __eot__ Why can't we just talk to the authorities? __eot__ Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't. __eot__ Then what else can we do? __eot__ Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us. __eot__ Who?
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him. __eot__ Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you. __eot__ You just feel sorry for me. __eot__ Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us. __eot__ It's okay, we're just about there.
He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him. __eot__ You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
Here we are. __eot__ Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
What the hell was that? __eot__ Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
You look great! __eot__ Save it for later.  Come on!
Rick, please. __eot__ Alright, I think I see salvation...
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them. __eot__ Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor. __eot__ It was Freddy. __eot__ Enough of that crap. __eot__ I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
T-T-Thanks Alice... __eot__ Earth to Alice...
Hey, Rick! __eot__ Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.
I don't get it. __eot__ Let me talk to you.
So what's up?  What'd I miss? __eot__ She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality. __eot__ So? __eot__ It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive. __eot__ Nice neighborhood. __eot__ Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
Hey man, we're all sorry... __eot__ She knew she was gonna die.
Been up with Alice. __eot__ How she doing?  I ran into her last night. __eot__ She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened. __eot__ About Freddy? __eot__ What else?  You ever look over this town's history?  Not a safe place to be a teenager.  Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back.
Something the matter with the cuisine? __eot__ Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite. __eot__ You're just tired.  Don't think I haven't noticed your not sleeping.  That has to stop, honey.
What's wrong with me? __eot__ Your distraught.  It'll help...
I'm sorry honey, but... __eot__ Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!! __eot__ Honey, we went over this in therapy. __eot__ Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...
Something wrong with the stairs? __eot__ Avoid-all-contact-day. __eot__ What? __eot__ When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
What is it? __eot__ Oh God!  He killed them!
Now you know who and what Freddy really is. __eot__ I though Freddy was just an old town story. __eot__ It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.
I'll tell you later. __eot__ It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream. __eot__ It's okay, babe.  We're with you. __eot__ I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
Feeling better now? __eot__ Yeah.  I guess so... What happened? __eot__ You had a nasty bump.
I gotta get out of here. __eot__ You just stay put.  You need rest. __eot__ You don't get it, he's after me... __eot__ Don't worry, honey
Excuse us, dear. __eot__ It's okay, Dan
Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby? __eot__ What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility. __eot__ And ours.  It's our grandchild.
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability -- __eot__ What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here. __eot__ You're not taking my baby!
Hey...wake up. __eot__ Huh?
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob? __eot__ It's lonely in there, in my room. __eot__ My name is...
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed. __eot__ How did you know that? __eot__ I could tell you were sad.  I just wanted to see if you were all right.
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right? __eot__ Been having bad dreams.
Is that who you're waiting for? __eot__ No...
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom. __eot__ She doesn't want me around __eot__ Oh...I'm sure that's not true.  I'll bet she's very worried about you.  I would be.
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me? __eot__ Who said I...wait, what?
Who says I don't like you? __eot__ My friend, with the funny hand.
Mommy...? __eot__ Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
Where is he? __eot__ He's inside you, where he hides.
What do you mean? __eot__ It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
But how...? __eot__ He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
Hi, beautiful. __eot__ Jesus!  Don't do that! __eot__ Sorry, babe.
The tickets. __eot__ They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon! __eot__ I know.
Okay, babe.  What's the matter? __eot__ Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony. __eot__ He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?
About him? __eot__ No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream. __eot__ Yeah...I guess. __eot__ You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember... __eot__ You're right. __eot__ There you go.  Love you. __eot__ Me too.
I was afraid you weren't coming. __eot__ I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing... __eot__ That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings. __eot__ No.  A deal's a deal.
Dad! __eot__ It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
Where are we going? __eot__ To take a picture.
Thanks for everything, Dad. __eot__ You sure you don't want a ride to work? __eot__ It's just across the park.
I'm so sorry, honey... __eot__ Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
How was the meeting? __eot__ Sobering... __eot__ Very funny. __eot__ Alice... __eot__ Since when are you such a smart shopper? __eot__ Since my little girl became a mom... __eot__ You disappointed in me? __eot__ No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
Alice! __eot__ I've got to go. __eot__ No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home. __eot__ But Dad -- __eot__ Now.
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile. __eot__ Had kind of a long night. __eot__ Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl. __eot__ No, the Dan part was nice...
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan. __eot__ Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way. __eot__ Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad? __eot__ There aren't any little boys on your floor. __eot__ He must've wandered up from the children's ward.  I just wondered what was wrong with him.
Did everyone call everyone? __eot__ They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
What's that got to do with it? __eot__ When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan. __eot__ No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it? __eot__ Why don't you two stick to reality.
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby? __eot__ I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself... __eot__ Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
I really think you need to calm down now, okay? __eot__ I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality. __eot__ Krueger is reality. __eot__ And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now! __eot__ What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while? __eot__ Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night... __eot__ That's the only reason you're alive...
Are you alright? __eot__ Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
You think that's the place she's buried? __eot__ If they actually bothered to bury her.
What? __eot__ Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
But how are we gonna -- __eot__ We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
You do good work, Alice. __eot__ So did Dan.
He sure loves to stay awake. __eot__ That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless. __eot__ I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis. __eot__ Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house. __eot__ Well we gotta do something!
I've got to write some of this down. __eot__ That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
Mark, are you okay? __eot__ Yeah.  I'm just aces.
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And... __eot__ I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?
I thought about that. __eot__ She must've fallen asleep at the table...
Then get out! __eot__ Mark!
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her? __eot__ Nobody thinks that.
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit. __eot__ It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy. __eot__ Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
Who's Jacob? __eot__ My baby! __eot__ What, you named it already?
Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet? __eot__ I don't know!
Where are you going? __eot__ I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him. __eot__ Then we'll find another way.
They think I'm nuts. __eot__ That's their problem.
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide? __eot__ That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought. __eot__ Meaning?
They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business. __eot__ But I've seen her grave. __eot__ Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool, huh?
Poor woman... __eot__ No shit.
I don't understand. __eot__ She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses? __eot__ Next life.  Oh, what's that? __eot__ My undying love.  Have some.
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom! __eot__ Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place. __eot__ You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes. __eot__ Who? __eot__ Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should.
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that. __eot__ I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
These things are wild...  What do you think? __eot__ Makes you look like a nun--
All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today... __eot__ Yeah... __eot__ That means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I'm done.
Have another one, sounds like you need it. __eot__ Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in? __eot__ Nah.  It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair.  She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.
Stop saying that, it's bullshit. __eot__ I want to talk about the baby.
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are. __eot__ Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first. __eot__ All of us.  Right?
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing. __eot__ Two hours a day, six days a week.
Vomit? __eot__ Faint.
Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?! __eot__ Mark... __eot__ I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it! __eot__ I can't listen to this.
It's okay. __eot__ Stick around, please?
You, too? __eot__ He invited me to his house last night.
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father. __eot__ It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago. __eot__ How is he - ? __eot__ It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along. __eot__ And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the Skipper?
You could train someone else. __eot__ Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
What is it? __eot__ Your 'out.'  This came for you. __eot__ My father!  He's not - ? __eot__ Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?' __eot__ Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you?  Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward! __eot__ <u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life... __eot__ We're <u>all</u> risking our lives! __eot__ That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here! __eot__ You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you? __eot__ Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow! __eot__ You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for? __eot__ Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot! __eot__ You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
Unidentified Flying Objects. __eot__ Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - ! __eot__ - any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there - __eot__ I'd sooner swim!
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder - __eot__ Yes? __eot__ Which is the one - we have to worry about?
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all. __eot__ But if they <u>do</u>? __eot__ I don't know. __eot__ I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father - __eot__ And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself - __eot__ But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance! __eot__ Helen.  I appeal to you -
Reef! __eot__ So they caught up with you, too? __eot__ At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now - __eot__ <u>That's</u> the worst possible moment? __eot__ What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl? __eot__ Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know! __eot__ Huh? __eot__ I might have a son like <u>that!</u>
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he? __eot__ I guess. __eot__ One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs. __eot__ So? __eot__ So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!' __eot__ A lot of people think like that.
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same. __eot__ Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side? __eot__ 'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
Cyclops? __eot__ Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
We're stuck tight! __eot__ Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
You've got to let us try, Skipper -- __eot__ 'Us?' __eot__ Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and ---
You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look. __eot__ Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up. __eot__ What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose! __eot__ I think you're right. __eot__ Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
Yeah? __eot__ Listen!  Hear that?
I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and - __eot__ Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here! __eot__ You know - it <u>is</u>?
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving! __eot__ Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
You hear that? __eot__ The sound again?
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from? __eot__ Somewhere down there? __eot__ Wonder where Powell and Carney are? __eot__ We'll have to look for them later.
Well? __eot__ I'm with <u>you!</u>
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone. __eot__ Oh it does???
Dave - ! __eot__ What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard. __eot__ Right, Skipper.
Is there any way out of it? __eot__ Seems to be all around... __eot__ What about down? __eot__ I...don't know!
Course and speed? __eot__ Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo! __eot__ What???
What course, Skipper? __eot__ Right at our one-eyed friend!
You better take Powell and Carney with you -- __eot__ The frogmen? __eot__ With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols -- __eot__ Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead. __eot__ We hope!
Excuse me, Skipper--- __eot__ Yes, Griff? __eot__ All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
Skipper - could you take a look here...? __eot__ Something wrong? __eot__ The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash. __eot__ Why do you say that? __eot__ We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving! __eot__ What????
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air! __eot__ Wonderful! __eot__ That's wonderful, Carl!  Reef thinks they can clear the Shark bow so we can pull ourself loose!
Now they feel it...down below. __eot__ Radiation level...constantly rising...
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot... __eot__ Anything --- __eot__ It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole. __eot__ What about time...?
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ? __eot__ Under <u>water</u>? __eot__ High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged.  And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
...above Murmansk, and Finland. __eot__ Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point! __eot__ What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit?  Perhaps be lying there waiting - ?
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>? __eot__ <u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale.... __eot__ The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all - the Earth itself!
....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'? __eot__ If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising! __eot__ What direction does the system indicate?
As we near the Pole... __eot__ There's got to be an explanation! __eot__ There is.  I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
All ready? __eot__ As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper. __eot__ I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway. __eot__ I met Dr. Kent, once.
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip. __eot__ Who with? __eot__ Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen? __eot__ Huh? __eot__ It'll be all right.  We're old friends!
What do you think? __eot__ I think I should have joined the Air Force!
Determine extent of damage, immediately. __eot__ After torpedo room:  Report!
You're sure it's Cyclops? __eot__ Take a look.
What's the running time? __eot__ Thirty-four seconds!
Right <u>at</u> him? __eot__ That's what I said! __eot__ But - what can we accomplish? __eot__ We can <u>ram</u> him!
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast.... __eot__ It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom. __eot__ And we're at safe maximum depth already....  Stop engines!
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops? __eot__ What? __eot__ If we could get inside the saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut the Shark loose?
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots! __eot__ Nothing we can do, now.
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole? __eot__ Minus three.
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone! __eot__ Come where?
That's a <u>face</u>??? __eot__ Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you. __eot__ Tell me something:  Why can <u>I</u> hear you, when the others couldn't?
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization - __eot__ - for horrors like yourself?
Swell! __eot__ Your friend was to remain where he was!
He did! __eot__ I am afraid not.  Therefore -
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act? __eot__ On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect. __eot__ Why? __eot__ I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself. __eot__ That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you? __eot__ Of course.  But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way? __eot__ Obviously. __eot__ <u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!
My yeoman will show you to your quarters. __eot__ Thank you.
See what? __eot__ The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
Well, I'll be - ! __eot__ I'll be another!
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus. __eot__ Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him! __eot__ Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times. __eot__ But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
Due north.  At five knots...no, six! __eot__ Toward the Pole!
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks. __eot__ All right - go to it.
You got yourself a computer, Alma. __eot__ Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk? __eot__ No. Black.
Are you alright, Wade? __eot__ Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay. __eot__ Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral. __eot__ Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town. __eot__ Always has been. __eot__ This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things. __eot__ Who? __eot__ Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him. __eot__ Who? __eot__ You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age. __eot__ Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question. __eot__ You don't believe me? __eot__ About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately? __eot__ I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in. __eot__ Has anybody offered to buy it? __eot__ As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh? __eot__ What is the Northcountry Development Association? __eot__ I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league. __eot__ Twombley involved? __eot__ No. __eot__ He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed. __eot__ All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town.
What are you boys up to? __eot__ Same old shit.
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news -- __eot__ Just tell me when you'll have it fixed. __eot__ -- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade. __eot__ Yeah. I know about that. __eot__ LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it? __eot__ Tell me. __eot__ Chub says you're fired. __eot__ He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning. __eot__ He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.
I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father. __eot__ It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work. __eot__ I plan to. Soon. __eot__ How soon? __eot__ This spring. __eot__ Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child. __eot__ It looks pretty hopeless, don't it? __eot__ No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it. __eot__ Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost? __eot__ Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred. __eot__ Oh. __eot__ You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the -- __eot__ Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I'm not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter.  I'll send you the five hundred.
You heard the news. __eot__ I hear Twombley got shot. __eot__ Yeah.
You see it? __eot__ Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in. __eot__ This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right? __eot__ Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me. __eot__ You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment. __eot__ Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I? __eot__ No, of course not. Just say it, that's all.
He's on to us! __eot__ Shit! What are we gonna do? __eot__ Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel. __eot__ You can't buy Wade off. __eot__ We bought you. __eot__ That was me.
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid. __eot__ Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten. __eot__ Guaranteed, eh? __eot__ Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it? __eot__ Damn straight!
Done much shooting with that rifle yet? __eot__ Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it. __eot__ If you get it? __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ You might not kill it. __eot__ You think so. __eot__ You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it. __eot__ You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine. __eot__ Mmm. __eot__ You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck. __eot__ I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time. __eot__ And you'll get your extra hundred bucks. __eot__ Wonderful!
I'm okay. __eot__ Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
I used to play ball. __eot__ Yeah? __eot__ Drafted by the Red Sox. __eot__ You played for the Sox? __eot__ Double A. New Britain. __eot__ Oh. __eot__ Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk." __eot__ Really. __eot__ They said. __eot__ Hmm. __eot__ The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck. __eot__ What happened? __eot__ Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm.
Safety on? __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ This way. __eot__ Sun's gettin high. __eot__ Deers have ears too.
Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around. __eot__ You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
Don't mind if I do. __eot__ LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies. __eot__ Where's that gun you were bragging on today?
No brag. Just fact. __eot__ Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks?
I thought I told you to move that truck! __eot__ Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke? __eot__ You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job. __eot__ Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. __eot__ Not here.
Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er -- __eot__ Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky. __eot__ Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there. __eot__ How'd you get the job? __eot__ Gordon, he's always got some angle working. He wants to keep Twombley happy, I'm his boy.
Like you and Gordon? __eot__ Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me. __eot__ Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him. __eot__ Right!
Bastard's got his high beams on. __eot__ Shit.
Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay? __eot__ Piece of fucking cake.
Where'd Twombley get shot? __eot__ In the chest. __eot__ No, I mean whereabouts. __eot__ A half mile in, along the old lumber road. __eot__ You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb. __eot__ The ambulance guys lugged him up. __eot__ You stayed away? __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ Where'd you get the blood? __eot__ What blood? __eot__ On your sleeve. __eot__ Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop? __eot__ I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean? __eot__ Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off. __eot__ I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something. __eot__ Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said. __eot__ Sure you did. __eot__ What? __eot__ Saw him do it? __eot__ What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that. __eot__ You musta seen him get shot. I know you did. __eot__ Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right. __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again. __eot__ He sure as hell won't.
I'm fucking out of here. __eot__ Lawford? __eot__ Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks.
Open the door, will ya? __eot__ Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad? __eot__ Open the door. We're late. __eot__ I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow. __eot__ What do you mean I got money? I'm as broke as you.
I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember. __eot__ Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy. __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
Those are the Hoyts. __eot__ I don't care. They're out. __eot__ Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble. See, they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there. They chopped down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little bastards. Jesus H. Christ.
Why do they do that? __eot__ Do what? __eot__ You know. __eot__ Break stuff? __eot__ Yeah. It's stupid. __eot__ I guess they're stupid. __eot__ Did you do that when you were a kid? __eot__ Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that. __eot__ Was it funny? __eot__ To us it was. __eot__ But it's not funny now. __eot__ It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change. __eot__ I bet you did lots of bad things. __eot__ What are you talking about? __eot__ I just think you used to be bad. __eot__ No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother? __eot__ No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know. __eot__ I don't want to. __eot__ Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long. __eot__ It's not that. __eot__ What then? __eot__ It's stupid. __eot__ It's fun. __eot__ I want to go home.  I don't like it here. __eot__ Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam.
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day. __eot__ No. __eot__ No what? __eot__ No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home. __eot__ You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here. __eot__ I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home. __eot__ Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something. __eot__ I called Mommy. __eot__ What? You called Mommy? Just now? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Jesus, why? __eot__ I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me. __eot__ Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first? __eot__ See, I knew you'd be mad. __eot__ Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake? __eot__ I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me. __eot__ Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother.  C'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves.
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait. __eot__ Yes. __eot__ That's all you got to say? "Yes". __eot__ Yes. __eot__ She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough.
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs. __eot__ That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
Dad. __eot__ I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
Are we going in this? __eot__ Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine. __eot__ It's pretty old. __eot__ It belongs to Pop. __eot__ Pop? __eot__ Grandpa. My father. It's his. __eot__ Oh.
How about a Big Mac? __eot__ Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you. __eot__ C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say? __eot__ No. __eot__ What do you want, then? __eot__ Nothing. __eot__ You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza? __eot__ Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says -- __eot__ I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though. __eot__ Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's. __eot__ Okay. __eot__ Fine.
Please don't cry. Please, honey. __eot__ What are you sorry for? __eot__ I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to. __eot__ I want to go home. __eot__ You can't.
That's illegal, you know. __eot__ I know. __eot__ You're a policeman. __eot__ Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore. __eot__ Oh.
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened. __eot__ I want to go home. __eot__ Okay, let's go home, then.
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all! __eot__ Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
Tomorrow, Gordon. __eot__ Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader. __eot__ Where's the plow? __eot__ Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley. __eot__ His son-in-law damn near killed me. __eot__ Huh? __eot__ At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass. __eot__ Don't go playing policeman. __eot__ What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends. __eot__ You don't want the extra police pay? __eot__ I'm not saying that. __eot__ Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left. __eot__ Fuck you. __eot__ That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.
What's the hurry? __eot__ A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley. __eot__ Huh? __eot__ I figured you already heard. __eot__ Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know? C'mon, you drive. We'll take my truck.
Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident? __eot__ Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume. __eot__ Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything? __eot__ You mean Twombley? __eot__ Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens. __eot__ I shoulda sent you instead of Jack. __eot__ I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader. __eot__ You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit. __eot__ Like hell.
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley. __eot__ You want me to follow them to Littleton? __eot__ Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling.
What the fuck. My day's already ruined.  Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do. __eot__ It ain't done, if that's what you mean. __eot__ Something bugging you? __eot__ Yeah. A few things. __eot__ Well, right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time.
How you holding up, Wade? __eot__ I'm fine, fine. __eot__ You Rolfe?  I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again. __eot__ You ever think of getting a new car, Wade? __eot__ On what you pay me? __eot__ Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
What do I have to do for it? __eot__ Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little. __eot__ I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning. __eot__ So? __eot__ He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it. __eot__ Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me. __eot__ You? Why? __eot__ Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal. __eot__ That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew. __eot__ What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there? __eot__ Want to buy? __eot__ Don't light that in here. I'm allergic. __eot__ I won't. You interested? __eot__ Maybe. __eot__ You and Mel Gordon? __eot__ Could be. __eot__ Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right.
Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys. __eot__ You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that? __eot__ The key, Wade. __eot__ Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
Lillian! __eot__ Where's Jill?
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids -- __eot__ Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname? __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ She's grown up some, hasn't she? __eot__ Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
I don't want her to go, Lillian. __eot__ Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse. __eot__ I'm not making it any worse. You are. Me and Jill could've worked this thing out. It's normal, it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it. Believe it or not. How do you think this makes me look, treating her like some tragic victim or something?
You ever come to your father's grave anymore? __eot__ No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far. __eot__ We should talk. __eot__ We've done all our talking, Wade. __eot__ It's just... __eot__ Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford? __eot__ Yeah, lots. __eot__ See. Get your boots. __eot__ Hi honey.
No problem. Look, I... __eot__ You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low. __eot__ Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter? __eot__ You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up? __eot__ Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody. __eot__ Did you get his number? __eot__ I know who it is. __eot__ Good. Who? __eot__ Mel Gordon. __eot__ I still don't understand -- __eot__ From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
New hat?  Jill's up, I see. __eot__ For a while. __eot__ How's she doing? __eot__ Okay. She's fine. __eot__ You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off.
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break. __eot__ See you tomorrow, maybe. __eot__ You okay? __eot__ Yeah.
You okay? __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ I'm sorry about what I said. __eot__ Said what? __eot__ About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian? __eot__ Forget it. __eot__ I'm sorry. __eot__ I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
You don't mean that. __eot__ Yeah. I mean that. __eot__ No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you. __eot__ The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
Call me. __eot__ Tonight. Let's get together. __eot__ Okay.
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks. __eot__ There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually. __eot__ I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her... __eot__ I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did. __eot__ ...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else. __eot__ I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose. __eot__ Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?
Money. __eot__ Jack doesn't need money. __eot__ Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that. __eot__ Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him? __eot__ Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia. __eot__ The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt? __eot__ No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age. __eot__ You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money. __eot__ No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know. __eot__ But not now.
I can see what you looked like as a kid. __eot__ You knew me as a kid. __eot__ Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way. __eot__ What way? __eot__ After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person. __eot__ It's nice.
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now? __eot__ I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight. __eot__ Then... I guess you have to. __eot__ There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me. __eot__ Oh, Wade. __eot__ I've been thinking about it, that's all. __eot__ You've been married twice -- __eot__ It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know? __eot__ Alright. I'll think about it. __eot__ Good.
Did you tell them?  That we were coming? __eot__ Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents? __eot__ I know your parents. __eot__ I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
Are you sure they're home? Did you call? __eot__ The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
Strange. __eot__ Think they're alright? __eot__ Of course! I would've heard. __eot__ How? __eot__ I don't know for Christ's sake!
This is nuts. __eot__ Wade.
What happened? __eot__ Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way? __eot__ It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it. __eot__ I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you? __eot__ Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
Going somewhere, Margie? __eot__ I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat. __eot__ Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that. __eot__ Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove. __eot__ There's a furnace. __eot__ You're not using it today? __eot__ It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom. __eot__ Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze.  Wade, would you do that?
Coffee's perked. __eot__ When did she die? __eot__ Is...? She's dead then?
It makes me sad. __eot__ Can --? __eot__ Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead. __eot__ How's that?
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.' __eot__ Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment. __eot__ What the hell are you talking about? __eot__ I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation. __eot__ Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts? __eot__ Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you-- __eot__ Hold on! __eot__ Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon. __eot__ You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something? __eot__ Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just -- __eot__ Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too. __eot__ Yes. Here's your ticket. __eot__ You get the hell out of my house now, asshole. And know this -- you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call, and I'm pissed enough to do it now!
Who are you? __eot__ I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here? __eot__ He's asleep. We were up very late. __eot__ Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley. __eot__ Mrs. Gordon. Thank you. __eot__ Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer. __eot__ Something about my father? __eot__ Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal. __eot__ Can't it wait, then?
Take care, Wade. __eot__ You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
It don't look right. __eot__ What? __eot__ The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something. __eot__ Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it. __eot__ I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too. __eot__ This town sucks. __eot__ Aw, c'mon, I was only saying there's something wrong with "Home Made Cooking", that's all. The sign's fine. What it says is wrong.
Marg! __eot__ That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different. __eot__ Marg! You got orders!
You talked to Jack? __eot__ Not since last night. He took a guy hunting. __eot__ The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental. __eot__ Jack? __eot__ The other guy. __eot__ Where... how'd you hear that? __eot__ CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow? __eot__ No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich? __eot__ It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall. __eot__ His office. You mean my old office. __eot__ Well, I guess -- that's what he said. __eot__ He got his deer yet? __eot__ No, he's out now. Somewhere on the mountain. I'd stay away from him if I were you. He's real pissed.
Rolfe. __eot__ A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day.  Sally, turn off that TV!
Just do it. __eot__ Atta-go.
What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it! __eot__ Nothing. __eot__ You no-good pup!
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma? __eot__ Sleeping. __eot__ You remember Margie Fogg? __eot__ From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee? __eot__ How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while. __eot__ We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her? __eot__ Yeah.
Where's Ma? __eot__ She's coming.
Yeah. __eot__ I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater. __eot__ Is there something wrong with the phone? __eot__ In the living room. __eot__ Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed? __eot__ Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop. __eot__ Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
Pop, for Christ's sake! __eot__ You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart! __eot__ You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you. __eot__ Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally done it! Like a man done it. Done it right. I love you, you mean sonofabitch!
Love! What the fuck do you know about love? __eot__ Love! I'm made of love! __eot__ Call it what you want. __eot__ Everything you know is from me. __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ Bang! __eot__ You and me.
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town! __eot__ Crawl! __eot__ Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen! __eot__ I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
Rolfe. __eot__ Wade? __eot__ Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley? __eot__ There was something. It happened up your way. __eot__ Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend. __eot__ Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits. __eot__ No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did.
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it. __eot__ He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business. __eot__ Who? __eot__ Twombley. __eot__ No shit. __eot__ You think Jack shot him? __eot__ Well, it was an accident. __eot__ They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
Lillian was here. In Lawford. __eot__ Huh? __eot__ The night before the shooting. __eot__ How was she? __eot__ Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home. __eot__ Who? __eot__ Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me. __eot__ What happened? __eot__ A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill.
Don't think about it. You're exhausted. __eot__ Yeah, I guess. __eot__ Get some sleep. __eot__ I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it. __eot__ Haven't you already done a bit of that? __eot__ No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess. __eot__ What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
Anyone else want one? Rolfe? __eot__ No thanks. I don't drink. __eot__ Yeah. I forgot.
What about Margie? __eot__ What about her? __eot__ Well, do you still plan to get married? __eot__ Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys. __eot__ Anything new about the shooting? Twombley? __eot__ I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks. __eot__ Want to know what I think happened?
Find them everywhere. __eot__ I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one. __eot__ Which is? __eot__ That it wasn't an accident. __eot__ Then who shot him? __eot__ Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt. __eot__ Motive. You gotta have a motive. __eot__ Money. __eot__ Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists. __eot__ They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead? __eot__ I don't know. You tell me. __eot__ Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon? __eot__ Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I? __eot__ Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved. __eot__ So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident. __eot__ A hunting accident is perfect. __eot__ Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off? __eot__ Not particularly. __eot__ Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right? __eot__ I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after. __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened. __eot__ Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it? __eot__ It may have happened, but not the way you said. __eot__ You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that? __eot__ It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne. __eot__ We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him. __eot__ And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft. __eot__ Well, I never heard that one. __eot__ I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence. __eot__ That's what you think.
Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another. __eot__ Wade, are you alright? __eot__ But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it. __eot__ For what?
To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on? __eot__ Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times. __eot__ Well, you aren't the President, dear. __eot__ Yeah, no duh.
You don't want to say hi to your father? __eot__ I'm sure he's busy. __eot__ Don't you even want to ask?
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream. __eot__ Alice... __eot__ Mom, just this once, give it a rest. __eot__ You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back... __eot__ Back at The Fishbowl?
We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime. __eot__ I know, Mom.  It was great... really.
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed. __eot__ I'm sorry, honey. __eot__ No, it's okay.  After all, he is the President, right?
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One. __eot__ Your father never means to be so... __eot__ I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important. __eot__ Some kids were teasing you? __eot__ That's not really the point.
You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel. __eot__ Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.
Mom? __eot__ Yes dear? __eot__ I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.
Daddy. Daddy, please... __eot__ Jim... for godsake!
I don't drink coffee. __eot__ You must be tired. It'll wake you up. __eot__ No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
You're one of Stravanavitch's men. __eot__ So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age. __eot__ Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents. __eot__ Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means? __eot__ Yeah. Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.
The woman you shot. She was my friend. __eot__ That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
Fuck off, you stupid asshole. __eot__ It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
He didn't leave us. __eot__ You are a resilient man, Mr.
Oooooh, I'm good. __eot__ Hey, you guys back already?
How was...  ...the ballet? __eot__ It was the experience of a lifetime. __eot__ How `bout a hug for the old man.
Alice! __eot__ Daddy...
Daddy... __eot__ Alice... I...
How you doing, sweetie? __eot__ Been better, Dad... You?
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god... __eot__ It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
There they are! __eot__ Okay, I'm slowing us down.
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747. __eot__ Did we warn them off? __eot__ Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement. __eot__ They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights. __eot__ The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet. __eot__ Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
Do you see the maintenance panel? __eot__ Got it. __eot__ Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up. __eot__ Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here. __eot__ Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them?
It's cut. __eot__ cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One. __eot__ Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here. __eot__ You read my mind. __eot__ Put your pilot on. __eot__ He's busy being dead.
Who's flying the fucking plane? __eot__ I'm doing what I can.
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing. __eot__ Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it? __eot__ Got it. __eot__ Stay cool.
How we doing, Colonel? __eot__ We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
Uh, we got a problem here. __eot__ Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in. __eot__ No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding. __eot__ Lemme take a look.
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control. __eot__ Sluggish... I think it's jammed too. __eot__ Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.
He's dead then. They must have killed him. __eot__ We don't know that. __eot__ Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands.
Walter, if you have a point, make it. __eot__ That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
They aren't answering their hails. __eot__ This doesn't make sense.
They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel. __eot__ I prefered the terrorists. __eot__ That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
Sir, you threw out page two. __eot__ Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib? __eot__ It was a good ad-lib, sir. __eot__ Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise. __eot__ Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise. __eot__ An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East. __eot__ Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
Can we do that? __eot__ We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
But they start executing hostages in __eot__ I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff. __eot__ Okay. Also, I want you to put our bases in Turkey on alert, and have the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike.
They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means? __eot__ Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission. __eot__ Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying. __eot__ If fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for? __eot__ To swear you in as President.
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this? __eot__ Yes, Mr. President. __eot__ Why? __eot__ Because it is my duty. __eot__ You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore. __eot__ My loyalty was never to my country.
Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane. __eot__ About goddamn time. __eot__ Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over. __eot__ Air Force One, acknowledged.  tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots. __eot__ Roger.
That's affirmative. __eot__ Ga get it.
We've already been inspected. __eot__ Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.
The rest of the secret service? __eot__ Dead. __eot__ How many others killed? __eot__ Nine. __eot__ Any of us?
Who did this? __eot__ We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for. __eot__ A secret service agent. It must be.
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable. __eot__ why did they do that? __eot__ Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us. __eot__ Well it worked.
How? __eot__ Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior. __eot__ Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.
We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left. __eot__ We're not going to make it. __eot__ Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq. __eot__ Where are we now? __eot__ Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia. __eot__ No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White House.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded. __eot__ Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over. __eot__ Stand by. __eot__ Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.
We copy. Stand by...  Tower? __eot__ Tower, here. __eot__ This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard. __eot__ Copy, Air Force One.
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person. __eot__ The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to. __eot__ This is a remarkable aircraft. __eot__ You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary. __eot__ A dubious distinction, no? __eot__ I guess it depends on your perspective.
And all these rooms here? __eot__ Conference rooms, though some have other functions.  The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.
Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews. __eot__ Thank you.
*                     Please tell me your name. __eot__ Maria... Maria Mitchell. __eot__ And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office. __eot__ How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell? __eot__ Scared. We're scared.
You're pointing a gun at me. __eot__ Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die. __eot__ What do you want with us? __eot__ Cooperation. If you try to escape, you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting. Good day.
Now, or he dies, please. __eot__ Come on, Alice.
Leave my daughter alone. __eot__ Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand... __eot__ What do you know of my husband? __eot__ I know he left you behind. __eot__ My husband is a very courageous man. __eot__ Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
Do you have to be so brutal? __eot__ Yes __eot__ Why? Do you enjoy it? __eot__ I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary. __eot__ How can you? I mean they're people.
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people. __eot__ That was war. __eot__ So is this.  Come now, you're upsetting the little one.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here. __eot__ No. __eot__ Say something dear.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists. __eot__ You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children. __eot__ Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
Four... __eot__ Jim... __eot__ Three...
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now? __eot__ You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind. __eot__ Over my dead body. __eot__ No. But since I only have a few of your staff left to kill, perhaps I will start with your family instead... Gibbs.
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me. __eot__ Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists. __eot__ Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
Stop. __eot__ You'll do it? __eot__ Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone. __eot__ Good. Good.
Someday, you'll regret my nature. __eot__ You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to
The taste of defeat is bitter, no? __eot__ One thing I've learned as
There goes your ride. __eot__ Let my daughter go or I'll take you out! __eot__ If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always. __eot__ Hold on, Alice.
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air. __eot__ Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes. __eot__ Twenty minutes? __eot__ You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks. __eot__ Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
Finally, we can bargain. __eot__ I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades. __eot__ They've gotta be joking.
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage. __eot__ Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there? __eot__ Gravity.
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back. __eot__ We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane... __eot__ They've cut communication, and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives. My only solution ran out of batteries.
Get `em ready.  You... come with me. __eot__ Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide. __eot__ Got it.
I'll not going without my family. __eot__ Yes, sir.
Sir, we stay with the President. __eot__ That isn't necessary.
May I speak to you for a moment? __eot__ Can't it wait? __eot__ No, Mr. President.  It can't.
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it. __eot__ Rose, I don't have time for this.
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person. __eot__ She's a big girl.  She understands. __eot__ How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks. __eot__ And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule.  What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?
You know what? __eot__ What? __eot__ I miss you. And I miss her. __eot__ But that's the point, Jim. We're right here. __eot__ I wish it were that easy...
I'll make it up to you, I promise. __eot__ I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut. __eot__ This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval.
How did your speech go? __eot__ Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer. __eot__ Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
I don't know why you stayed. __eot__ Please... don't start with me.
Call Petrov...  I'll be back. __eot__ Both of you.
What are you doing? __eot__ Flying the plane. __eot__ You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
The fax machines. __eot__ Excuse me? __eot__ The fax machines. __eot__ No good. I said they disabled the communications system. __eot__ No. I thought about this, Mr.
Where are we sending it? __eot__ White House Situation room.
Someone should give you a raise. __eot__ Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
Did they say anything about my family? __eot__ They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes. __eot__ Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.
and if that means negotiating... __eot__ You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target. __eot__ But this is different, sir. You're the President.
Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution? __eot__ Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?
What's going on? __eot__ We're under attack. __eot__ Where's my family? __eot__ We're handling it, sir.
One. __eot__ But... __eot__ Two... THREE. GO!
White House switchboard. How may I direct your call. __eot__ Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there? __eot__ who can I say is calling? __eot__ This is the President. __eot__ Yeah, right. __eot__ Don't cut me off. This is an emergency. __eot__ Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced. __eot__ You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday? __eot__ Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the.... __eot__ Thank you for calling the white House... __eot__ No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch. __eot__ I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
You wanna knock of f? __eot__ No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say? __eot__ He and the NRA don't like the wording.
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch. __eot__ I might still have a few chips left. __eot__ *                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that. __eot__ This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns. __eot__ Other way around, sir. __eot__ Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
It's bait.  Don't take it. __eot__ Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging. __eot__ Did we tape the Duke game?
I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please. __eot__ We'll just say it was in bad taste.
You give me ulcers. __eot__ That's my job.
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation. __eot__ Yes, sir.
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room. __eot__ Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board? __eot__ I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
Shepherd. __eot__ Sir...
My god. I think that was a MiG. __eot__ A MiG? Where the hell are we?
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq. __eot__ Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
Shit. __eot__ How long's it been since you flew, sir? __eot__ Twenty-five years.
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment. __eot__ They better. Fuel's almost gone.
IT'S OPEN! __eot__ DO YOU SEE TEEM?
WE'RE HOOKED! __eot__ We're hooked. Hove into position.
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing. __eot__ Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them. __eot__ Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board. __eot__ Commissioner.
What? __eot__ I just wish it was that simple.
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago. __eot__ That just doesn't make any sense. __eot__ I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one. __eot__ I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down... __eot__ You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I want him pulled.  Jacobs, pull Oveur!
Forget it.  I was reading. __eot__ I was reading too. __eot__ What's the story? __eot__ Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor... __eot__ I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.
Kruger, Sagittarius. __eot__ Commissioner, Aquarius.
Did you feel that? __eot__ Yes I did... __eot__ Felt like a large asteroid. __eot__ Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question? __eot__ What is it, Mary? __eot__ Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
Oveur. __eot__ Dunn.
Shut down accelerators. __eot__ Accelerators down.
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir. __eot__ You better check it, Unger.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four. __eot__ You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
Dunn. __eot__ Sir? __eot__ You better take this.
Elaine. __eot__ Te...! __eot__ That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.
It's got to be stopped! __eot__ But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out. __eot__ I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
Ted, what's wrong? __eot__ Ask Simon.
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground. __eot__ There's nothing wrong with me! __eot__ Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti. __eot__ You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!
Elaine. __eot__ Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
Elaine, what happened to us? __eot__ Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better. __eot__ Who's that, Ted? __eot__ Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way. __eot__ And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says. __eot__ Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go. __eot__ If that's the way you want it. __eot__ That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go. __eot__ Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.
Ted!  What are you...? __eot__ I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
Ted, we're taking off! __eot__ Let me by, Elaine.
What are you doing, Ted? __eot__ I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
Ted. __eot__ Not now, Elaine! __eot__ Ted!
Elaine. __eot__ Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove. __eot__ Elaine, we have to go back. __eot__ We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over. __eot__ Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital. __eot__ Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane. __eot__ I've never used the word insane, Ted. __eot__ What word would you use, Elaine? __eot__ The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick. __eot__ What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face. __eot__ I'd use the word insane. __eot__ There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg. __eot__ Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.
Elaine! __eot__ Ted! __eot__ Elaine, what's going on? __eot__ Ted, there's no time to explain.
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can. __eot__ Ted, please be careful.
Ted, we've only got ten minutes. __eot__ Not now, Elaine. __eot__ I mean until we start to burn up.
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program. __eot__ That was very well put, Ted.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something. __eot__ I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will. __eot__ That might be the news we've been waiting for.
Simon just ejected! __eot__ Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now. __eot__ You mean... __eot__ That's right -- premature ejection. __eot__ What will happen to him, Ted? __eot__ The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
Are you afraid? __eot__ Not when I'm with you, Ted. __eot__ I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change! __eot__ Set! __eot__ Now! __eot__ Compute!
Ted, the lever! __eot__ Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor. __eot__ The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick. __eot__ What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol. __eot__ I mean for Ted. __eot__ You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden. __eot__ Is that a good sign, Doctor?
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine. __eot__ Is he making any progress, Doctor? __eot__ Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission. __eot__ Simon. __eot__ Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run. __eot__ And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl. __eot__ But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe. __eot__ You're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.
Frank's the best pilot in the program. __eot__ I'm so excited, Simon. __eot__ I guess this is a first for you. __eot__ No, I've been excited before.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East. __eot__ Simon, why has he become so... so... __eot__ So mentally ill?
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore. __eot__ Don't be too long.
Have you got it straightened out now? __eot__ I think so. __eot__ That's my girl.
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit. __eot__ Roger.
Simon, what's happening?! __eot__ He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun. __eot__ Can't we change course? __eot__ We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
My career is shot. __eot__ Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there. __eot__ Maybe. __eot__ Simon, what are you saying?!
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications. __eot__ Yes, sir.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain. __eot__ I see.  What do you think our alternatives are? __eot__ We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
Roger. __eot__ You can do it from up here, Captain. __eot__ I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine. __eot__ No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit. __eot__ Roger.  You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
Intermitant failure in scan mode "R". Analyze. __eot__ Negative. __eot__ That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis. __eot__ Negative. __eot__ That's not possible. __eot__ Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago. __eot__ That's okay, ROK. __eot__ Can I say something of a personal nature to you? __eot__ Go ahead. __eot__ You have great tits.
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check. __eot__ Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I... __eot__ Request; life support systems check. __eot__ Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that. __eot__ Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes. __eot__ There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>.
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad? __eot__ We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us. __eot__ I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury. __eot__ Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad? __eot__ It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet. __eot__ No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'? __eot__ Look, a man can make an honest mistake!! Anyway, she was asking for it!  They're all asking for it all the time!!
Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name? __eot__ Scraps. __eot__ Can I hold him? __eot__ Sure. __eot__ He's a boy dog. __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?
Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there. __eot__ We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes... __eot__ Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency. __eot__ I don't want to hear that word! __eot__ Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country. __eot__ All right.  Here. __eot__ What...?
Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people. __eot__ I don't want to live anymore. __eot__ Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance. __eot__ What? __eot__ That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you. __eot__ You're sure? __eot__ I'm sure.
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over. __eot__ How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over. __eot__ No.  Poached.  Over. __eot__ Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over. __eot__ Just poached on toast.  Over.
That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over. __eot__ All right, Captain Oveur.  Over. __eot__ Poached!  Not over!  Over!
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it. __eot__ Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
Which passenger is Joe Salucci? __eot__ Sixteen 'C', why? __eot__ He's carrying a bomb. __eot__ A b...
No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge. __eot__ What should I say? __eot__ Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.
Captain Oveur? __eot__ Mr. Kurtz, I presume. __eot__ We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything.
That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians. __eot__ Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?
Good to be aboard, gentlemen. __eot__ Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.
Whenever your're ready, Captain. __eot__ Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
You folks need any help? __eot__ Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays. __eot__ Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work. __eot__ Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute. __eot__ Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it. __eot__ Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
I have to see Bud Kruger. __eot__ Do you have an appointment, sir? __eot__ No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death. __eot__ You'll have to be more specific than that, sir. __eot__ All right, it's a matter of death. __eot__ Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
You can't go in there! __eot__ Don't try to stop me! __eot__ But that's not a door.  The door's over there.
Are you on the Mercury mission? __eot__ That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker. __eot__ Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures. __eot__ You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications. __eot__ I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
Striker. __eot__ Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship? __eot__ That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out. __eot__ Then Elaine was right. __eot__ Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way! __eot__ Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I be of some help? __eot__ Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing. __eot__ You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington. __eot__ Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist? __eot__ Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury. __eot__ I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go. __eot__ You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.
You've been hurt. __eot__ I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it. __eot__ No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse.
Do you want to talk about it. __eot__ I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me. __eot__ No.  I mean your relationship. __eot__ We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore. __eot__ Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change. __eot__ People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own. __eot__ Not if the people change together in relation to that love. __eot__ Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged. __eot__ Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love. __eot__ I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying. __eot__ Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee. __eot__ That's very nice of you. Thank you.
Ah, won't you sit down? __eot__ Thank you. Cream? __eot__ No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men. __eot__ Were you vacationing in Los Angeles? __eot__ Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.? __eot__ No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business. __eot__ Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to. __eot__ But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married? __eot__ Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer. __eot__ I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage. __eot__ I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me. __eot__ You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean. __eot__ Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff. __eot__ That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone? __eot__ No. I'm all alone. __eot__ Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years. __eot__ That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer. __eot__ Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there. __eot__ Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer. __eot__ Something about a plane with no pilot?
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much. __eot__ Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it. __eot__ Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
Both pilots! __eot__ Can you fly this airplane and land it? __eot__ Surely you can't be serious. __eot__ I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had? __eot__ Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines. It's an entirely different kind of flying...<u>all</u> <u>together</u>!!!
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got. __eot__ Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment. __eot__ Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport? __eot__ Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing? __eot__ I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time. __eot__ Surely there must be something you can do. __eot__ I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!
George Zipp said that? __eot__ And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure." __eot__ Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land.
Captain, how soon can we land? __eot__ I can't tell.
Can't you take a guess? __eot__ Well...not for another two hours. __eot__ You can't take a guess for another two hours? __eot__ No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!
What is it, Doctor? What's happening? __eot__ I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor? __eot__ That's right. __eot__ We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them? __eot__ Yes. Yes, of course.
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital. __eot__ A hospital? What is it? __eot__ It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him. __eot__ Certainly.
What was it we had for dinner tonight? __eot__ Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish. __eot__ Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
What did he have? __eot__ He had fish.
Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too. __eot__ Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat? __eot__ He had fish, too.
Just how serious is it, doctor? __eot__ Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts? __eot__ No. __eot__ All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane? __eot__ Well...
No. No one that I know of. __eot__ I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
Elaine! __eot__ Ted! __eot__ I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you. __eot__ I just don't want to go over it any more. __eot__ I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out. __eot__ I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that. __eot__ Don't you feel anything for me at all any more? __eot__ It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over. __eot__ I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run. __eot__ Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change. __eot__ Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record. __eot__ Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history. __eot__ You expect me to believe that?
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility. __eot__ But if you'll just give me... __eot__ It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.
Ted, what are you doing here? __eot__ Elaine, I've got to talk to you. __eot__ You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.
What's the matter? __eot__ My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission. __eot__ Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much. __eot__ I love you, Elaine. __eot__ I love you.
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember? __eot__ I remember everything. All I have are memories.
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us. __eot__ That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine. __eot__ But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!
You got a telegram from head­quarters today. __eot__ Headquarters!? What is it? __eot__ It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news?
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid. __eot__ Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp. __eot__ Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
What's his problem? __eot__ That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball! __eot__ Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war. __eot__ A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane! __eot__ That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
Rain. __eot__ And a little ice. __eot__ And a little ice!
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge. __eot__ Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts. __eot__ It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
Rats! I've lost number three. __eot__ What happened, Ted? What went wrong? __eot__ Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.
But Ted, you're the only... __eot__ I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.
Ted... __eot__ Yes? __eot__ I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud. __eot__ Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land. __eot__ The gear is down.
See them, Elaine? __eot__ Uh-huh.
We have a visitor. __eot__ Hello.
We'd better get back now. __eot__ Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight. __eot__ Who wants to be first?
Airsick? __eot__ I think so, but I've never seen it so acute. __eot__ Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much. __eot__ You promise you'll write. __eot__ Every day.
Good-bye, darling. __eot__ Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time. __eot__ So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself. __eot__ Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill. __eot__ Good-bye, darling. __eot__ Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling. __eot__ Good-bye, darling.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson? __eot__ Yes, Captain? __eot__ Did you decide on a runway yet? __eot__ Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner. __eot__ You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole! __eot__ Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.
He's right on the heading. __eot__ All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago. __eot__ Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?' __eot__ Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
Oh, I can't stand it. __eot__ What is it?
How ya doing, honey? __eot__ Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up. __eot__ Here.
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers! __eot__ I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets! __eot__ I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies. __eot__ I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense. __eot__ Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner. __eot__ ...and that lots of times you don't even run down court. __eot__ We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner. __eot__ ...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs. __eot__ The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.
Hi! __eot__ I'm Randy. __eot__ I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar! __eot__ I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song. __eot__ Oh, I'd love to. __eot__ Okay, this is one of my favorites.
Would either of you like another cup of coffee? __eot__ I will, but Jim won't.
Yes? __eot__ Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please? __eot__ Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner? __eot__ Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why? __eot__ Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly.
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln. __eot__ Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
Roger. __eot__ Huh?
Roger. __eot__ Huh?
We have clearance, Clarence. __eot__ Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence? __eot__ No, why don't you take care ot it?
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here. __eot__ All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
Excuse me, Sister? __eot__ Yes? __eot__ There's a little girl on board who's ill and... __eot__ Oh yes, I saw. Poor child. __eot__ Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up. __eot__ Of course.
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right. __eot__ Thank you.
Do you feel all right, sir? __eot__ Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner? __eot__ No. No thank you.
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering... __eot__ The cockpit? What is it? __eot__ It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it. __eot__ Would you go up, please?
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready. __eot__ Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes. __eot__ Does that cost extra or you throw them in? __eot__ You've got me all wrong.  I don't charge money for something that I myself find pleasurable...
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes. __eot__ The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows. __eot__ Todd?  Todd doesn't know either.
I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us? __eot__ Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later. __eot__ A virgin.  I find that very arousing...
There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally. __eot__ I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons. __eot__ I like my horizons narrow. __eot__ Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
You okay? __eot__ Yeah...
You are Cassandra? __eot__ That's right. __eot__ We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am-- __eot__ Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.
He's not here.  Why ask me? __eot__ The young woman at the front said you might know where he is. __eot__ She did, did she?  Well, she was wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change.
In there. __eot__ Show me.
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers? __eot__ Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay? __eot__ You don't have squat. __eot__ You ever try to make a case in Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes...
Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron! __eot__ I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.
Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy? __eot__ Lay off, asshole. __eot__ I may be an asshole, but at least I'm a real detective, not some outer shit space thing.
William Harcourt? __eot__ Yes... __eot__ I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department. __eot__ Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic. __eot__ You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing. __eot__ That's right.  He and I, along with seven or eight others.  Listen, gentlemen, I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately, at the moment, I'm overdue at another function.
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history... __eot__ No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver. __eot__ This is becoming a serious breach of security. __eot__ He didn't recognize me. __eot__ It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley. __eot__ This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.
Kill them both. __eot__ Here? __eot__ Do it!
... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all. __eot__ Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing. __eot__ What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to. __eot__ I am George.
Man, somebody really hung one on you!  I've heard some good ones for you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley Davidson.  I guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while, coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you. You weren't at the back of the line, were you, George? __eot__ My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'. __eot__ Gesundheit.  You don't mind if I stick to George, do you?
Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care? __eot__ That is exactly so.  It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like "ss'ai k'ss", two words in my language which mean "excrement" and "cranium".
Let's talk Hubley. __eot__ His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown. __eot__ With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest. __eot__ Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts. __eot__ Nice signal, dickwad!
Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off? __eot__ There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings. __eot__ The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George... __eot__ The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--
Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Well, there's a thing about partners, about being somebody's partner.  You do for each other. And other people's rules don't mean shit.  It's the rules set up between the two of you, that's all that counts.  Understand?  Okay.  Well, my friend and partner was shot last night and I'm after the shitbag that did it.  As my partner, I'm asking you to respect me and help me find him.
What is wrong? __eot__ Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?
Well... yes, quite possibly. __eot__ Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you? __eot__ Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I-- __eot__ Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
What's this?  What's going on? __eot__ Nothing. __eot__ Nothing? __eot__ Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
What is this? __eot__ A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
Get the picture? __eot__ And that fits? __eot__ Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches. __eot__ And still it fits?
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks. __eot__ How the hell do you know that? __eot__ A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one. __eot__ So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night. __eot__ I believe I should interview the widow alone. __eot__ Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well. __eot__ Did you learn anything? __eot__ A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley. __eot__ Aw-right.  What about the other guy? __eot__ She didn't know him.  But she said her son might. __eot__ Did you talk to him? __eot__ He has not been home since that day. But she told me where to find him.
Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time... __eot__ We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
Why did you do it? __eot__ Why'd I do what? __eot__ Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner... __eot__ My partner is dead!  Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing...
Who said that? __eot__ At the end of the bar.
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it? __eot__ Uh, Matthew... __eot__ Back off, George. __eot__ But I-- . __eot__ I'll handle it.
Screw you. __eot__ Screw me?  That can't be right.
Tell me. __eot__ Your mother mates out of season. __eot__ That's very colorful.  But see -- now I've got a problem.  I don't seem to be getting much cooperation from you, Porter.  So I guess we're gonna have to take this little session down to my office, ya know?
Matthew, you don't have to-- . __eot__ Stay back!  I'm okay.
You know that guy? __eot__ From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together. __eot__ How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him? __eot__ In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...
If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for. __eot__ Yeah, sure.  I knew that...
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English? __eot__ Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
Which one is that?  Raw what? __eot__ This is mole.  It's good. __eot__ I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two? __eot__ Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka? __eot__ Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation. __eot__ And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one. __eot__ Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'. __eot__ Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.
Who is he? __eot__ Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch. __eot__ When will Strader return?
I believe he is probably lying. __eot__ Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she? __eot__ My wife?  She worries about me.
Yeah... I know the routine. __eot__ You are married? __eot__ Was.  Divorced. __eot__ We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us. __eot__ It's like having an eleventh finger removed.  It hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place.
Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in. __eot__ I appreciate your honesty, George.
Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then... __eot__ Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
... and so, and so the doctor says, "If this is the thermometer, then where'd I leave the pen?"  You're not... you don't think that's funny?  George, work with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be? __eot__ In the other man's rectum. __eot__ Sticking out of his ass... yeah! See, that's what makes it a joke. There's like a surprise, and your mind fills in the funny picture. Here's this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it's a thermometer.  Nada, huh?
Your health... __eot__ Ta ss'trakyona'...
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other. __eot__ No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes. __eot__ You humans are very curious to us. You invite us to live among you, in an atmosphere of equality we've never known before.  You lay before us a beautiful green world, full of freedoms and opportunities... You give us ownership of our lives for the first time... and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves: to live by the rules... rules that aren't made to keep one people subordinate to another, but rules that exist to preserve equality.  You aspire to very high ideals here.
I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are.  So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves. __eot__ Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals.
I'm going home. __eot__ Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
Where'd you get this?!! __eot__ A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife...
She's going to divorce me. __eot__ George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember? __eot__ She's very progressive.  I'm certain she's considering it.
Well, let's roll, George. __eot__ To the... to the beach? __eot__ Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!
Stop the car. __eot__ Why? __eot__ Please, I must get out here. __eot__ Come on, you won't have to get near the water. __eot__ Stop the car!
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes. __eot__ Thank you.
What was that about? __eot__ Nothing.
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style. __eot__ Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub... __eot__ ... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart.  So what the hell's the connection?
What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it. __eot__ You must leave me alone on this.
No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now! __eot__ No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern. __eot__ The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it? __eot__ ... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic. __eot__ How potent? __eot__ Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor. __eot__ We?  You've taken it? __eot__ We all did. __eot__ Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship? __eot__ No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded. __eot__ Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me? __eot__ Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again. __eot__ I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt-- __eot__ Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart. __eot__ If the drug is here, we must destroy it. __eot__ No, George -- you're missing the point.  The drug is evidence.  We need to have the evidence, ya know?
Uh, George... __eot__ Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones... __eot__ Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.
George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit. __eot__ The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street. __eot__ Why?  What's the big goddamn deal?
 __eot__ Fuck procedure.
Shit! __eot__ Ss-ai!
With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now. __eot__ It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.
What's this about, George?  I know that look. __eot__ There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
No!  We must do this alone. __eot__ Do what?!  George-- ?!
What is this?! __eot__ ... It's Harcourt. __eot__ Harcourt is dead. __eot__ No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're... __eot__ Tell me about it...
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up. __eot__ We can't let him get away. __eot__ Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up? __eot__ Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming. __eot__ But there's no more drug. __eot__ You understand that.  But how many others will?
How do I look? __eot__ You look very good.
You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it. __eot__ What is it? __eot__ Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads. __eot__ Only holds five. __eot__ Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one. __eot__ No... two.
Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes. __eot__ Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
You think this is the guy who did it? __eot__ We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him? __eot__ To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me. __eot__ Who else can I ask around here? __eot__ Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off. __eot__ I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
That where Anderson worked? __eot__ Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.
Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up. __eot__ ... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery. __eot__ Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'? __eot__ For you, anything.
Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son. __eot__ Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here. __eot__ I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems to be matching up...
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing? __eot__ Sure.  Just a minute.
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter? __eot__ Ss'kya'ta'. __eot__ What's that?
One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him? __eot__ Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters. __eot__ Yeah, I heard of it. __eot__ That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning... __eot__ Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car-- __eot__ The human? __eot__ Yeah... he was one Martin Helder. White male, twenty-seven.  Let's see... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction, a couple for sale of a controlled substance. Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock.
No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match. __eot__ Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
You took this gut out, too, didn't you? __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts. __eot__ Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him. __eot__ That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff. __eot__ Yeah, I'll bet.
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet? __eot__ You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
What kind of test? __eot__ Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day. __eot__ Did he find anything?
Yeah, Sykes? __eot__ Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk. __eot__ Departmental policy. __eot__ You?
Granger and Pitts are already on it. __eot__ Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community... __eot__ Don't tell me what to think.
Hope their plumbing's the same. __eot__ It is.
How can I go? __eot__ Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going. __eot__ What? __eot__ Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week... __eot__ Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But-- __eot__ But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing. __eot__ Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers.
Does that look at all suspicious to you? __eot__ Whatever gave you that idea?
You got your vest? __eot__ Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car. __eot__ Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.
Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door. __eot__ I got him.  Don't get pinned.
Get outta there! __eot__ I can't!  Do you mind! __eot__ I'll cover you!  Get outta there!!
This floor's freezing. __eot__ Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson? __eot__ Would you, Sir?
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed. __eot__ Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op? __eot__ Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
Movement! __eot__ Position? __eot__ Can't lock up... __eot__ Talk to me, Hudson. __eot__ Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
...that's better.  Pan it around a bit. __eot__ Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
Okay, let's do it. __eot__ Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station. __eot__ Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear. __eot__ Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung. __eot__ Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over. __eot__ Say again?  All after incinerators?
I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon. __eot__ Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least. __eot__ Yes.  That follows. __eot__ But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from. __eot__ That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs. __eot__ You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs? __eot__ Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society. __eot__ Could it be intelligent? __eot__ Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting. __eot__ How long until it blows? __eot__ I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons.
And it's too late to shut it down? __eot__ I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.
I'll go. __eot__ What? __eot__ I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid. __eot__ All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?
It's going to be closer.  You better get going. __eot__ See you soon.
HOW MUCH TIME? __eot__ PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES! __eot__ WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
Ripley... __eot__ She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it. __eot__ In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.
You did okay, Bishop. __eot__ Well, thanks, I --
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ... __eot__ You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
Have they located my daughter yet? __eot__ Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
Is she...? __eot__ Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.
Amy. __eot__ Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate. __eot__ Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys... __eot__ I get the picture. __eot__ Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo. __eot__ They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case. __eot__ You are a head case.  Have a donut.
No.  There's no way! __eot__ Hear me out... __eot__ I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there?  Forget it.
What about you?  What's your interest in this? __eot__ Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial. __eot__ I heard you were working in the cargo docks. __eot__ That's right. __eot__ Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing? __eot__ It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse. __eot__ What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract? __eot__ If I go. __eot__ If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse... __eot__ Spare me, Burke.  I've had my psych evaluation this month.
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over... __eot__ No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi... __eot__ Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever. __eot__ That's the plan.  My word on it.
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not? __eot__ Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
I hope you're right.  I really do. __eot__ I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
That the atmosphere processor? __eot__ Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
They're right under the primary heat exchangers. __eot__ Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built... __eot__ That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system. __eot__ She's right.
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure. __eot__ Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action. __eot__ Why not?
Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it -- __eot__ They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second? __eot__ This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them -- __eot__ Bullshit!
You son of a bitch. __eot__ Don't make me pull rank, Ripley. __eot__ What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here. __eot__ Corporal Hicks!? __eot__ This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command.  Right?
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life. __eot__ You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code. __eot__ You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it. __eot__ But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here -- __eot__ Now, wait a second -- __eot__ You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them? __eot__ Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this. __eot__ Sorry to disappoint you.
Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all. __eot__ You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety. __eot__ These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant? __eot__ We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
Still nothing from the colony? __eot__ Dead on all channels.
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony. __eot__ It's insured.
What's he scanning for? __eot__ PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
We're talking thermonuclear explosion. __eot__ Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant? __eot__ Thirty-eight...simulated.
Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex. __eot__ The structure seems intact.  They have power.
One of us? __eot__ Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
Where are your parents?  You have to try... __eot__ Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
What is it? __eot__ I don't know. __eot__ Proceed inside.
So. __eot__ So...then the fusion containment shuts down. __eot__ So?  So?
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW! __eot__ Shut up.  Just shut up!
I told them to fall back... __eot__ They're but off!  Do something!
How do you feel? __eot__ All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I... __eot__ Forget it.
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but... __eot__ Sir? __eot__ Yes, Hicks? __eot__ Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks. __eot__ What's the question? __eot__ Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt? __eot__ All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.
Are there any questions?  Hudson? __eot__ How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower... __eot__ ...We're coming in. __eot__ He's coming in.  I feel safer already.
Sir, the CPU is on-line. __eot__ Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em. __eot__ Alive? __eot__ Unknown.  But, it looks like all of them.  Over at the processing station...sublevel 'C' under the south tower.
We're not making that out too well.  What is it? __eot__ You tell me.  I only work here.
Save it. __eot__ Sure, Hicks.
Let's get the fuck out of here! __eot__ Not that tunnel, the other one!
Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now! __eot__ Are you finished?  You okay?
Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose. __eot__ Aye-firmative.
We got problems. __eot__ I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
Maybe we got 'em demoralized. __eot__ I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
The corner!  Ready? __eot__ Do it!
Seventeen meters. __eot__ Let's get these things lit.
Well you're not reading it right! __eot__ Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
Let's go!  Let's go! __eot__ Fuckin' A!
Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off. __eot__ Poor bastard.
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue? __eot__ About seventeen days.
All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door. __eot__ We gotta figure on them getting into the complex. __eot__ That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections...  ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.
They're in the approach corridor. __eot__ On my way.
Now many? __eot__ Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
Newt time then can walk right up and knock. __eot__ But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
They'll get us. __eot__ Maybe.  Maybe not. __eot__ Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that? __eot__ If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
What's this? __eot__ Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that. __eot__ Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself. __eot__ Yeah.  I've noticed.
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it. __eot__ The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage. __eot__ Let's waste him.  No offense.
It's game time. __eot__ Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed. __eot__ We didn't miss anything.
Locked. __eot__ Stand back.
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to -- __eot__ All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
Hicks, don't let him leave. __eot__ We ain't going anywhere.
Ellen. __eot__ Don't be long, Ellen.
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man? __eot__ No.  Have you?
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up. __eot__ Fuck you. __eot__ Anytime.  Anywhere.
All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest? __eot__ Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us. __eot__ Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!
Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man! __eot__ Hudson, give us a break.
It's inside the complex. __eot__ You're just reading me. __eot__ No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're inside.  Inside the perimeter. They're in here.
Sounds like you, Hicks. __eot__ The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
Looks like it stung him. __eot__ Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others. __eot__ Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before... __eot__ She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth. __eot__ Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
Thanks. __eot__ Uh, what's next?
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow. __eot__ How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted. __eot__ I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something. __eot__ Think of what?  We're fucked. __eot__ What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually. __eot__ Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.
They cut the power. __eot__ What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place... __eot__ Just get back here!
Range twenty meters. __eot__ Seal the door.
Fifteen meters. __eot__ I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters. __eot__ They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?
Nine meters.  Eight. __eot__ Can't be.  That's inside the room! __eot__ It's readin' right.  Look!
You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago? __eot__ Yeah.  What? __eot__ There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored. __eot__ Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.' __eot__ So what do I tell this guy? __eot__ Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
And how are we today? __eot__ Terrible. __eot__ Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least. __eot__ How long have I been on Gateway station? __eot__ Just a couple of days.  Do you feel up to a visitor?
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep? __eot__ No.. I've slept enough.
What did you say? __eot__ Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
Casey.  She's my only friend. __eot__ What about me?
I don't want you for a friend. __eot__ Why not? __eot__ Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would. __eot__ They're dead. __eot__ Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise. __eot__ You promise? __eot__ Cross my heart. __eot__ And hope to die?
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze. __eot__ The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts? __eot__ Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody. __eot__ You're really something, ace.
I guess we're not leaving, right? __eot__ I'm sorry, Newt. __eot__ You don't have to be sorry.  It wasn't your fault.
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted. __eot__ I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic. __eot__ Oh.  Sorry, Newt. __eot__ My mommy always said there were no monsters.  No real ones.  But there are.
Yes, there are, aren't there. __eot__ Why do they tell little kids that?
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can. __eot__ Did one of those things grow inside her?
I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth. __eot__ Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you? __eot__ No, it's different, honey. __eot__ Did you ever have a baby? __eot__ Yes.  A little girl. __eot__ Where is she? __eot__ Gone. __eot__ You mean dead.
Don't go!  Please. __eot__ I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
Newt.  Newt, wake up. __eot__ Wah...?  Where are...? __eot__ Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble.
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared. __eot__ I know, honey.  Me too.
Burke!  Open the door! __eot__ Look!
Come on.  Crawl faster. __eot__ DO you know how to get to the landing field from here? __eot__ Sure.  Go left.
This way.  Come on, we're almost there! __eot__ Newt, wait!
I knew you'd come. __eot__ Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight.
Mommy...Mommy? __eot__ Right here, baby.  Right here.
Are we going to sleep now? __eot__ That's right. __eot__ Can we dream? __eot__ Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
Look, I told you... __eot__ It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe... __eot__ That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!  Like I said.
Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise... __eot__ Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be... __eot__ ...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching...
Why won't you check out LV-426? __eot__ Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now. __eot__ What are you talking about. What people?
How many colonists? __eot__ Sixty, maybe seventy families. __eot__ Sweet Jesus.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish! __eot__ Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine! __eot__ A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. __eot__ I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade! __eot__ A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. __eot__ At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown!
Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word. __eot__ Certainly!
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you? __eot__ Indeed. __eot__ These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it. __eot__ His Grace is very angry with you. __eot__ What do you mean?
Maestro. __eot__ Good morning. __eot__ Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year! __eot__ Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip. __eot__ Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart. __eot__ Oh? News travels fast in Vienna. __eot__ And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Is there a part for me? __eot__ No. __eot__ How do you know? __eot__ Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one. __eot__ Why not? __eot__ Well, do you know where it's set, my dear? __eot__ Where? __eot__ In a harem. __eot__ What's that? __eot__ A brothel. __eot__ Oh! __eot__ A Turkish brothel. __eot__ Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it. __eot__ My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.
Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway. __eot__ Perhaps.
What does he look like? __eot__ You might be disappointed. __eot__ Why? __eot__ Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina. __eot__ Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
Did you know? Had you heard? __eot__ What? __eot__ The marriage! __eot__ Well, what does it matter to you? __eot__ Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
How was I? Tell me honestly. __eot__ You were sublime. __eot__ What did you think of the music? __eot__ Extremely clever. __eot__ Meaning you didn't like it.
Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage. __eot__ Don't bother! __eot__ What? __eot__ Don't bother. __eot__ I'll be right back.
Oh - excuse me! __eot__ Is her mother still lying on the floor? __eot__ No, she's fine. __eot__ I'm so relieved.
Is she a good fuck? __eot__ What?? __eot__ I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.
No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang? __eot__ Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
No! I won't have him back. __eot__ But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding. __eot__ Hardly. __eot__ Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him. __eot__ I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him. __eot__ Sir - __eot__ Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat. __eot__ Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully. __eot__ And how will you make him keep it? __eot__ Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance. __eot__ You have leave to try. __eot__ Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
Why what, sir? __eot__ Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants? __eot__ Humiliated? __eot__ How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me. __eot__ I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come. __eot__ No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy. __eot__ Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.
Don Giovannnnnnnni! __eot__ Who the devil are you? What do you want? __eot__ I've come to dinnnnnner! __eot__ Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height. __eot__ Are you drunk? You invited me. And my horse. Here he is. Ottavio!
In the pot, I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew, but a singer. Not a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat! __eot__ Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.
What is it? __eot__ I want to go! __eot__ Where? __eot__ I want to go back to Vienna. __eot__ Now? __eot__ Yes! __eot__ Why? __eot__ I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here. __eot__ What are you talking about?
Stop it! __eot__ I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we are going back.
No! No! No! __eot__ Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are? __eot__ Where? __eot__ We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg. __eot__ Fartsbishop!
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man. __eot__ Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway. __eot__ Why not? __eot__ Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards. __eot__ That's stupid. __eot__ Why? People fart backwards. __eot__ Do you think that's funny? __eot__ Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
Oh, ha, ha, ha. __eot__ Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick! __eot__ Yes, you are. You're very sick. __eot__ No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards! __eot__ Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse! __eot__ Em iram! Em iram! __eot__ No, I'm not playing this game. __eot__ No, this is serious. Say it backwards. __eot__ No! __eot__ Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram! __eot__ Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that. __eot__ Ui-vol-i-tub! __eot__ Tub - but i-tub - but I vol - love but I love ui - You. I love you!
Tish-I'm tee. What's that? __eot__ What? __eot__ Tish-I'm-tee. __eot__ Eat __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Eat my - ah!
Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now? __eot__ Of course.
I think you're mad! You're really mad! __eot__ Oh, leave me alone. __eot__ One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life! __eot__ They'll come anyway. They love me here. __eot__ No, they will not. I know how things work in this city. __eot__ Oh yes? You always know everything. __eot__ Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that! __eot__ You borrowed money from your mother? __eot__ Yes! __eot__ Well, don't do that again! __eot__ How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg? __eot__ Don't be stupid. __eot__ All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that? __eot__ Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them. __eot__ This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity!
Stop it now. Stop it. I've brought some friends to meet you. They're next door waiting. Do we have anything to eat? They're all starving. __eot__ Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody. __eot__ What's the matter with you? __eot__ Tell them to go! __eot__ Sssh. What is it? Tell me. __eot__ No! __eot__ Yes! __eot__ I love you! I love you!
My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter? __eot__ Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart. __eot__ He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa.
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart? __eot__ Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you? __eot__ Wolfi! __eot__ What? How can you be so boring? Tea! __eot__ Wolfi, I think your father's tired. I'll cook us something here.
There's a young girl to see you. __eot__ What does she want? __eot__ I don't know. __eot__ Well, ask her! __eot__ She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you. __eot__ Oh, damn!
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can - __eot__ Stanzi! __eot__ No, it's right he should hear. I'm sick to death of it. We can't do anything right for you, can we?
We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder?  This is! a very nice girl. __eot__ Wolfi. __eot__ Yes, my love? __eot__ These gentlemen are from Salzburg. __eot__ Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with! __eot__ Wolfi! Your father is dead. __eot__ What? __eot__ Your father is dead.
Half the receipts! Stanzi! __eot__ I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
You're not going to do this? __eot__ Why not? Half the house! __eot__ When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it. __eot__ Oh, Stanzi. __eot__ I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common. __eot__ Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki. __eot__ Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand. __eot__ Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand! __eot__ Shut up! I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money.
Who was that? __eot__ No one. __eot__ I heard voices.
What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this? __eot__ I'm not telling you. __eot__ Why not? __eot__ You'd think I was mad.
No. Don't answer it! __eot__ Why?
This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I? __eot__ Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard. __eot__ Give me two more weeks. Please.
Give me one reason I can understand. __eot__ I can't write it! __eot__ Why not? __eot__ It's killing me.
Go back to bed. __eot__ Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
Excellency! __eot__ Madame. How can I help you?
Frau Mozart? __eot__ That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment. __eot__ How charming.  But why did he not come himself? __eot__ He's terribly busy, sir. __eot__ I understand.
I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest. __eot__ Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait. __eot__ I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe. __eot__ I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here. __eot__ Really? __eot__ My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come. __eot__ Then he didn't send you? __eot__ No, sir. This is my own idea. __eot__ I see. __eot__ Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!
Thank you very much, Your Excellency. __eot__ Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like. __eot__ That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals. __eot__ Originals? __eot__ Yes.
These are originals? __eot__ Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
It is miraculous. __eot__ Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his. __eot__ Oh, thank you, sir!
Come back tonight. __eot__ Tonight? __eot__ Alone. __eot__ What for? __eot__ Some service deserves service in return. No? __eot__ What do you mean? __eot__ Isn't it obvious?
It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight. __eot__ But! I'm a married woman! __eot__ Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go? __eot__ What? __eot__ Should we stay here? It's a charming room. I love these candlesticks. Were they here earlier? I didn't notice them I suppose I was too nervous.
What are you doing here? __eot__ Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home. __eot__ Why you? __eot__ I was at hand. __eot__ Well, thank you very much. You can go now. __eot__ He needs me, ma'am. __eot__ No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please. __eot__ He asked me to stay. __eot__ And I'm asking you -
This is not his handwriting. __eot__ No. I was assisting him. He asked me. __eot__ He's not going to work on this anymore. It is making him ill. Please.
I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go. __eot__ Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here.
How much will you pay him? __eot__ Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
Am I interrupting something? __eot__ Not at all. __eot__ Where's our friend? __eot__ He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you. __eot__ I hope so. I need it immediately.
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting? __eot__ Leave him alone! __eot__ I'm paying these people. Do you realize that? __eot__ He's doing his best. __eot__ I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous! __eot__ You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff! __eot__ Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem? __eot__ Money! Money! __eot__ You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi. __eot__ Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?
I see that you're expecting. __eot__ Oh, yes. __eot__ When, may I ask? __eot__ In three months! Papa.
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time. __eot__ But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of! __eot__ Well, this is none of your business.  Whoever sent you is going to pay, no?
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat. __eot__ And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day? __eot__ Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper! __eot__ So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time. __eot__ Do you hear him? Do you?
Be careful! __eot__ Be careful!
He's adorable! __eot__ Adorable!
Behold! __eot__ Behold!
Hey! __eot__ Hey!
Behold! __eot__ Behold!
Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor. __eot__ I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted. __eot__ Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests! __eot__ I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders. __eot__ Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass. __eot__ Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
Upstairs. __eot__ Gertrude! __eot__ You can't be Herr Mozart!
I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man. __eot__ Gertrude! __eot__ It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude. __eot__ People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so. __eot__ Michael, please! I'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart. She's really very excited. She's been preparing all morning.
I said play! __eot__ Michael!
What a strange young man. __eot__ Yes. He is a little strange.
Really? __eot__ Ah, now! Here she comes.
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate? __eot__ I'd like a little wine, if you have it. __eot__ Wine?
Just one year. __eot__ Who was your teacher? __eot__ I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her. __eot__ Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention. __eot__ You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
What a charming idea. May I see? __eot__ It's just a trifle, of course. __eot__ May I try it? __eot__ Majesty.
Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in? __eot__ You do me too much honour, Sire. __eot__ Let's have some fun.  Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But slowly, slowly. I need a minute to practice.
A-flat, Majesty. __eot__ Ah-ha!
And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri. __eot__ Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
My pleasure. __eot__ Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
Well, I'm glad to hear that. __eot__ Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn. __eot__ Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well, tell him, Mozart. Name us a German virtue.
Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth. __eot__ Your Highness.
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour! __eot__ I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
An interesting idea, Majesty. But - __eot__ Yes? __eot__ You already commissioned an opera from Mozart. __eot__ And the result satisfies. __eot__ Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism. __eot__ Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart. __eot__ I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes. __eot__ You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea. __eot__ Sire. __eot__ Well. There it is.
I don't think you understand me, Court Composer. __eot__ Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart. __eot__ Why not? __eot__ Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming. __eot__ Oh?
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician. __eot__ Of course not. __eot__ I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies. __eot__ Really? __eot__ As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well! __eot__ Yes? __eot__ Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
Do you like this, Salieri? __eot__ It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid. __eot__ Well, look at them.
Your Majesty! __eot__ No, no, please! It is not a holy relic.  You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old.  He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no?
Oh, thank you. __eot__ The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg. __eot__ Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you. __eot__ Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
Majesty! __eot__ Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
Why so? __eot__ Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
Well, what is it about? Tell us the story. __eot__ It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -
Yes, where? __eot__ In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio. __eot__ Ah-ha.
Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head. __eot__ What? On one hearing only? __eot__ I think so, Sire, yes.
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire? __eot__ Yes, indeed. __eot__ And German? __eot__ Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably! __eot__ So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty? __eot__ Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate. __eot__ What do you mean, Sire? __eot__ Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less. __eot__ My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect. __eot__ Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady. __eot__ Enchanted, Madame.
Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry? __eot__ Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
Excuse me, but how old are you? __eot__ Twenty-six. __eot__ Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna.
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man. __eot__ Thank you, Sire!
Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour? __eot__ What is it? __eot__ May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him. __eot__ Ah! By all means.
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre? __eot__ Yes, Sire. __eot__ Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true? __eot__ Who told you this, Majesty? __eot__ It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true? __eot__ Well, yes, I admit it is. __eot__ Would you tell me why? __eot__ Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here. __eot__ Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics. __eot__ I think you are rather innocent, my friend. In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece.
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love. __eot__ Ah, love again. __eot__ But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that? __eot__ I have no idea. __eot__ Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it. __eot__ Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight! __eot__ Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.
Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not. __eot__ You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade. __eot__ Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it?
Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely? __eot__ I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop. __eot__ Very small pay, I imagine. I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre.
Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain? __eot__ In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.
Yes, sir. __eot__ Well. There it is.
Well, what do you have for me today? __eot__ Your Majesty, Herr Mozart - __eot__ Yes, what about him? __eot__ He's here. __eot__ Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good.
I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming. __eot__ I will.
Why are you here? __eot__ Am I not welcome? __eot__ Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!
Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see. __eot__ Is she not here? __eot__ I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
Do you always live like this? __eot__ Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me. __eot__ Don't you have a maid? __eot__ Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself. __eot__ How is your financial situation? __eot__ It couldn't be better. __eot__ That's not what I hear. __eot__ What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here. __eot__ They say you're in debt. __eot__ Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie! __eot__ How many pupils do you have? __eot__ Pupils? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Yes. __eot__ How many? __eot__ I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition. __eot__ Composition doesn't pay. You know that. __eot__ This one will.
What's that? __eot__ Oh, let's not talk about it. __eot__ Why not? __eot__ It's a secret. __eot__ You don't have secrets from me. __eot__ It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted. __eot__ Why didn't you mention it in your letters? __eot__ Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me. __eot__ Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!
No, really! __eot__ This is just a game, Papa.
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say! __eot__ I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me. __eot__ But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
Papa, is this your idea? __eot__ Mine?
Are you playing a trick on me? __eot__ I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving! __eot__ Papa! __eot__ Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden. __eot__ No one calls you that. __eot__ She does. She says I sleep all day.
Father - __eot__ Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning. __eot__ Good morning, sir. __eot__ What have you got for me today? Let me see.
Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker. __eot__ I will, sir.
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl? __eot__ Yes, thank you, sir. __eot__ Bene! Bene!
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir. __eot__ Bene.
Oh, thank you, sir. __eot__ Do any pupils come to the house? __eot__ Not that I've seen. __eot__ Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all? __eot__ Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat. __eot__ Really? What is it he's writing? __eot__ Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir. __eot__ Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
I think I've found out about the money, sir. __eot__ Yes what?
Where does he work? __eot__ In there, sir.
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you? __eot__ I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared! __eot__ Why? What has happened? __eot__ You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse. __eot__ What medicine? __eot__ I don't know. He has pains. __eot__ Where? __eot__ Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over. __eot__ Is he working? __eot__ I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead. __eot__ Is he working? __eot__ I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera. __eot__ Opera? Opera! __eot__ Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened. __eot__ Are you sure it's an opera?
Yes? __eot__ Are you Herr Mozart? __eot__ That's right. __eot__ My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you. __eot__ What? __eot__ They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is? __eot__ Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
Sssh! __eot__ Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi! __eot__ Sssh! Stay here.
What did he say? What did he say? __eot__ Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
Well? __eot__ Sublime! Utterly sublime! __eot__ That kind of music should be punishable by death.
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you? __eot__ Yes, well, it's all good fun. __eot__ I liked the horse.
Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them. __eot__ I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it. __eot__ 'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those. __eot__ Animals? __eot__ I tell you I picked up a snake in Dresden last week - twelve foot long  - folds up to six inches, just like a paper fan. It's a miracle.
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German. __eot__ German! __eot__ Of course! What else do you think they speak here? __eot__ No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio. __eot__ So there you are. What do you say?
Leave that alone! __eot__ Wolfi! __eot__ Put it down! __eot__ What is this? __eot__ Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you. __eot__ Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished? __eot__ What? __eot__ What? The vaudeville, what'd you think? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Can I see it? __eot__ No. __eot__ Why not? __eot__ Because there's nothing to see.
Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes. __eot__ Well, we can. __eot__ So let me see it. Where is it?
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children. __eot__ And which one of them do you want me to teach? __eot__ What? Ha-ha! That's funny - I like it. Which one, eh? You're a funny fellow.  Hannah! Come this way.
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife. __eot__ Madame. __eot__ This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?
I'm afraid I am. __eot__ Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg. __eot__ Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart? __eot__ Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart! __eot__ Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you? __eot__ Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music? __eot__ Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man. __eot__ Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction? __eot__ What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you? __eot__ Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead? __eot__ What for? __eot__ If a man cannot earn, he must borrow. __eot__ Well, this is hardly the way to go about it. __eot__ No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
I'm sorry. No. __eot__ Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir. __eot__ My answer is no, Mozart.
I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours? __eot__ Really? __eot__ Mio caro Adone. __eot__ Ah! __eot__ A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.
Love, Sire! __eot__ Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty. __eot__ But this is absurd!
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations. __eot__ Did you like it, then? __eot__ How could I not? __eot__ It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
Herr Mozart, what brings you here? __eot__ Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now. __eot__ So you are. How is your pretty wife? __eot__ She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know. __eot__ I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course. __eot__ So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't. __eot__ Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted? __eot__ I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled. __eot__ Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please! __eot__ My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late. __eot__ Whom did they choose? __eot__ Herr Sommer. __eot__ Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity. __eot__ No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity. __eot__ But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess! __eot__ An implausible idea. Between you and me, no one in the world could do musical harm to the Princess Elizabeth.
Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage. __eot__ You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty? __eot__ No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why. __eot__ It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means. __eot__ How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all! __eot__ How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful. __eot__ They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend! __eot__ Of course not. __eot__ Do you have a daughter? __eot__ I'm afraid not. __eot__ Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe! __eot__ Ah, how exciting! Tell me more. __eot__ I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret. __eot__ Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly. __eot__ Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it? __eot__ Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone. __eot__ Ah. Italian? __eot__ Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind. __eot__ Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty? __eot__ What exactly are you working on? __eot__ I can't say. Really __eot__ I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?
Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter? __eot__ It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it. __eot__ Really? Why? __eot__ I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him? __eot__ Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours. __eot__ Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry! __eot__ You burned the score? __eot__ Oh no! My wife took it out in time. __eot__ How fortunate. __eot__ It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work. __eot__ But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor. __eot__ Oh, Excellency, would you? __eot__ With all my heart, Mozart. __eot__ Thank you! Oh, thank you.
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn. __eot__ I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully. __eot__ But what is it they don't like? __eot__ Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four. __eot__ What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all? __eot__ I think it's marvelous. Truly. __eot__ It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come? __eot__ I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap? __eot__ I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that. __eot__ I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me. __eot__ Oh no, the honour would be all mine. __eot__ Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang! __eot__ Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!
Mozart. It was good of you to come. __eot__ How could I not? __eot__ Did my work please you? __eot__ How could it not, Excellency? __eot__ Yes? __eot__ I never knew that music like that was possible. __eot__ You flatter me. __eot__ Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
I have come to commission work from you. __eot__ What work? __eot__ A Mass for the dead. __eot__ What dead? Who is dead? __eot__ A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one. __eot__ Who are you? __eot__ I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well. __eot__ How much?
How long will you give me? __eot__ Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time. __eot__ Are you neglecting my request? __eot__ No, no! I promise you, I'll give you a wonderful piece - the best I ever can!
What happened? Is it over? __eot__ I'm taking you home. You're not well. __eot__ No, no. I have to get back. I have -
Where is your wife? __eot__ Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa. __eot__ You mean she's not coming back? __eot__ You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you. __eot__ No, please. __eot__ I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that. __eot__ This is only a vaudeville. __eot__ Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me. __eot__ Do you mean that? __eot__ I do. __eot__ I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things. __eot__ Are you ill? __eot__ The doctor thinks I am. But - __eot__ What? __eot__ I'm too young to be so sick.
Shall I answer it? __eot__ No! No, it's him! __eot__ Who? __eot__ The man. He's here. __eot__ What man?
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it. __eot__ Finish what? __eot__ He knows. He knows!
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred? __eot__ Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way? __eot__ Would you? Actually, you could. __eot__ My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure. __eot__ But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed. __eot__ Of course. __eot__ You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write. __eot__ Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work? __eot__ A Mass. A Mass for the Dead.
Where did I stop? __eot__ The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra. __eot__ So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that? __eot__ Consigned to flames of woe. __eot__ Do you believe in it? __eot__ What? __eot__ A fire which never dies. Burning one forever? __eot__ Oh, yes. __eot__ Strange! __eot__ Come. Let's begin.
Confutatis Maledictis. __eot__ We ended in F Major? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ So now - A minor. Suddenly.
The Fire. __eot__ What time? __eot__ Common time.
Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, second beat.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  G-sharp, of course. __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that? __eot__ I think so. __eot__ Sing it back.
Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Fourth measure, second beat - F.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm.  The first bassoon and tenor trombone - __eot__ Please! Just one moment.
It couldn't be simpler. __eot__ First bassoon and tenor trombone - what? __eot__ With the tenors. __eot__ Also identical? __eot__ Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant.
And that's all? __eot__ Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
Do you have me? __eot__ I think so. __eot__ Show me.
That's wonderful! __eot__ Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.
C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis. __eot__ Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'? __eot__ Yes, and on 'dictis'. __eot__ Yes!
And that's it. Do you have it? __eot__ You go fast! __eot__ Do you have it? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Then let me hear it. All of it. The whole thing from the beginning - now!
Do you want to rest a bit? __eot__ Oh no. I'm not tired at all. __eot__ We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa. __eot__ I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try? __eot__ Would you stay with me while I sleep a little? __eot__ I'm not leaving you. __eot__ I am so ashamed. __eot__ What for? __eot__ I was foolish. I thought you did not care for my work - or me. Forgive me. Forgive me!
Oh? Have I seen it? __eot__ I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately. __eot__ I think you'd better.
You mean in Turkey? __eot__ Exactly. __eot__ Then why especially does it have to be in German? __eot__ Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.
What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts. __eot__ But, Your Majesty -
That will do, Herr Mozart! __eot__ Just let me tell you how it begins.
Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away. __eot__ Certainly, Herr Director.
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas? __eot__ Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding. __eot__ Exactly. A dance. __eot__ But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story. __eot__ It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.
What are you doing, Herr Director? __eot__ Taking out what you should never have put in.
Can we see the scene with the music back, please? __eot__ Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
What is this, Herr Chamberlain? __eot__ What is what? __eot__ Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl. __eot__ Because His Majesty wishes it. __eot__ Is the Emperor angry with me? __eot__ On the contrary. __eot__ Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post? __eot__ Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna. __eot__ No, but I'm the best. __eot__ A little modesty would suit you better. __eot__ Who is on this committee? __eot__ Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri. __eot__ Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians! __eot__ Mozart - __eot__ They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid. __eot__ Mozart - __eot__ Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music! __eot__ Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues. __eot__ Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not!
Herr Mozart - __eot__ May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
I don't think it was really decided, Director. __eot__ Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre? __eot__ Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine. __eot__ Baron!
Mozart - __eot__ Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous? __eot__ Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes? __eot__ Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends? __eot__ Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty.
What do you want? __eot__ I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone. __eot__ About what? __eot__ You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you? __eot__ So? __eot__ In the sight of God that is a sin. __eot__ What do you want? __eot__ Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely. __eot__ Leave me alone. __eot__ I cannot leave alone a soul in pain. __eot__ Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you? __eot__ That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes. __eot__ Are they? __eot__ Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness. __eot__ I do not seek forgiveness. __eot__ My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me. __eot__ How well are you trained in music? __eot__ I know a little. I studied it in my youth. __eot__ Where? __eot__ Here in Vienna. __eot__ Then you must know this.
I can't say I do. What is it? __eot__ I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
Well? __eot__ I regret it is not too familiar. __eot__ Can you recall no melody of mine? I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy. I wrote forty operas alone. What about this little thing?
Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that. __eot__ I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is? __eot__ Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing. __eot__ Ah - you've heard that? __eot__ All Vienna has heard that. __eot__ And do they believe it? __eot__ Is it true? __eot__ Do you believe it? __eot__ Should I?
Do you hear me? __eot__ He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them. __eot__ Did you try? __eot__ Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!
Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God. __eot__ You cannot say that! __eot__ No? Was Mozart a good man? __eot__ God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know. __eot__ All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him! __eot__ My son, no one can speak for God. __eot__ Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me! __eot__ I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should. __eot__ Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Always the same stale answers!  There is no God of Mercy, Father. Just a God of torture.
What? __eot__ His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him. __eot__ I did. __eot__ No, you didn't! __eot__ I poisoned his life. __eot__ But not his body. __eot__ What difference does that make? __eot__ My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it? __eot__ No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God! __eot__ Oh my son, my poor son! __eot__ Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director. __eot__ Yes? __eot__ Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera. __eot__ Italian?
You mean that play? __eot__ Exactly. __eot__ He's setting that play to music? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ You must be mad.
Are you absolutely sure? __eot__ I've seen the manuscript. __eot__ Where? __eot__ Never mind.
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing. __eot__ Incredible. __eot__ The Emperor has given him permission.
What anger? __eot__ About the ballet. __eot__ Ballet? What ballet? __eot__ Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera? __eot__ Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro? __eot__ Yes, in the third act.
Bravo, Your Majesty! __eot__ Well done, Sire!
Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian. __eot__ Did we?
I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director? __eot__ For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France. __eot__ Oh yes, yes. And that was? __eot__ Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor. __eot__ Ah.
Here I am, my angel. __eot__ What? Who the devil are you? __eot__ I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish. __eot__ Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you. __eot__ I can't wait. __eot__ Well, promise then. __eot__ What do you mean - now? __eot__ Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough? __eot__ Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop. __eot__ I agree, Baron. __eot__ Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him? __eot__ No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him. __eot__ How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent. __eot__ Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you. __eot__ Who is she? __eot__ She didn't say. But she says it's urgent. __eot__ Excuse me, my dear.
That lady is back, sir. __eot__ Show her in. Then go to bed.
What does he want? __eot__ He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting. __eot__ Come with me. And stay in the room.
Herr Salieri. __eot__ Yes, I am looking after him. __eot__ Can we come in? __eot__ Well, he's sleeping now. Better not. __eot__ But he's all right? __eot__ Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest. __eot__ Well, tell him we were here, won't you? __eot__ Of course. __eot__ And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times. __eot__ Bene. __eot__ I'll call tomorrow. __eot__ Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh? __eot__ Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet? __eot__ The American? Yes, duck. __eot__ How did he look? __eot__ What do you mean, 'how did he look'? __eot__ You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food? __eot__ I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them. __eot__ Thank you.
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago. __eot__ Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
Can I be of service, Miss Price? __eot__ Dr. Hirsch? __eot__ Go about your duties. __eot__ Yes, Doctor.
Oh, Miss Price? __eot__ Yes, Doctor? __eot__ What exactly did he call out? __eot__ He said 'Jack'. __eot__ That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed. __eot__ What happened to them? __eot__ The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price. __eot__ No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.
Did he say a wolf? __eot__ Yes, I believe he did.
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have. __eot__ Come to my office, Miss Price.
Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David. __eot__ Yes, sir. __eot__ It's a full moon. Where is he? __eot__ At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
He's not? __eot__ Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies? __eot__ Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend. __eot__ Has his friend appeared to him again? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ What did he say? __eot__ David says Jack comes to warn him. __eot__ Warn him? __eot__ Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know? __eot__ I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things. __eot__ Yes. __eot__ They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there. __eot__ And what else? __eot__ I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.
You've absolutely no idea where David might be? __eot__ No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.
Surely you're not suggesting... __eot__ David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon? __eot__ Dr. Hirsch? __eot__ Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others. __eot__ What shall we do? __eot__ Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
He's here. __eot__ Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he? __eot__ He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo. __eot__ The zoo? Is he rational? __eot__ Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean. __eot__ Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television? __eot__ No, why? __eot__ Is David acting strangely? __eot__ No, not really.
Could you get here without any trouble? __eot__ Yes, I should think so. __eot__ Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand? __eot__ Yes, Doctor. __eot__ You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help? __eot__ He's fine. We'll come right over. __eot__ Shall I send a car? __eot__ No, a cab will be faster. __eot__ I expect you shortly.
What shall we do? __eot__ Tea would be nice.
Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog. __eot__ David? __eot__ I doubt it. But it's something to do.
It wasn't a lunatic. __eot__ I beg your pardon? __eot__ It was a wolf. __eot__ What? __eot__ A wolf.
Mr. Kessler? __eot__ Yes? __eot__ You haven't eaten your lunch. __eot__ I'm not very hungry, thank you. __eot__ I'm afraid you have to eat something. __eot__ Please, really. I'm not hungry. __eot__ You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler. __eot__ How is that? __eot__ Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills? __eot__ Leave the pills. I'll take them later. __eot__ Sorry.
Aw come on, Miss Price! __eot__ Call me Alex. __eot__ Aw come on, Alex! __eot__ Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
Call me David. __eot__ Shall I be forced to feed you, David? __eot__ This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food. __eot__ Right.
Let's try a little harder, shall we? __eot__ Will you give me a break?
You're a very beautiful girl. __eot__ I thought you were asleep. __eot__ I was. What are you reading? __eot__ 'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain. __eot__ Do you like it? __eot__ I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
What do you dream about? __eot__ I dream of death mostly. __eot__ I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you. __eot__ It's okay. I want to talk to you.
How old are you? __eot__ That's not really a very proper question. __eot__ How old are you? __eot__ Twenty-eight. __eot__ I'm twenty-seven. __eot__ I know. __eot__ Now what do you want to talk about? __eot__ Was Jack Goodman your good friend? __eot__ My best friend. My very best friend. __eot__ Shall I read to you? __eot__ What? Oh, yes, please. __eot__ A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right? __eot__ Yes, go on. __eot__ Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...
Hello. You all right? __eot__ I'm sorry I woke you up. __eot__ Don't be silly. Can I get you something? __eot__ No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while. __eot__ That's easy enough. __eot__ I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them. __eot__ David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away. __eot__ Will you come with me? __eot__ What? __eot__ I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship. __eot__ Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now. __eot__ Will you think about it? __eot__ How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient? __eot__ Not just a patient -- me. __eot__ You're being awfully forward, aren't you? __eot__ Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it. __eot__ All I am to you is a sex fantasy then? __eot__ Now I'm embarrassed. __eot__ Good. I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room.
I'm a werewolf. __eot__ A werewolf?
Are you better now? __eot__ I'll let you know the next full moon. __eot__ You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
My friend Jack was just here. __eot__ Your dead friend Jack? __eot__ Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think? __eot__ What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends? __eot__ I was dreaming again? __eot__ I would think so. __eot__ Yeah, I would think so, too.
The kitchen. __eot__ Very nice.
Closet. __eot__ Charming. __eot__ Bathroom. __eot__ Lovely. __eot__ The bedroom. __eot__ There is only one bed. __eot__ David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower.
It's nice to see you. __eot__ It's nice to see you.
Alex? __eot__ Yes? __eot__ Will you be here in about fifteen minutes? __eot__ Of course. __eot__ Good.
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really? __eot__ I was awake and he was in my room. __eot__ But, David. __eot__ I wasn't hallucinating.
Tomorrow is the full moon. __eot__ That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.
Let me go now, you'll make me late. __eot__ Do me an enormous favor? __eot__ Anything. __eot__ Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive. __eot__ It's silly of you to be apprehensive. __eot__ Werewolves simply do not exist. __eot__ David, do you want me to stay here tonight? __eot__ Yeah, I do, but go to work.
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay? __eot__ Okay. __eot__ I've left those pills for you. __eot__ A doper werewolf.
I'm off. There's food in the fridge. __eot__ See you later.
David! Where on earth have you been!?! __eot__ I'm freezing.
Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific! __eot__ The zoo? __eot__ Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex? __eot__ Don't you remember? __eot__ I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo!  I guess I am out of my fucking mind.
The next corner we can get a cab. __eot__ I should be committed. __eot__ Dr. Hirsch will know what to do. __eot__ I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
But... __eot__ Pull over.
David, what are you doing? __eot__ Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex. __eot__ David, stop!
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I... __eot__ Jack is dead! __eot__ Jack is dead. Look, six people have been killed. I'm going to the police.
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch. __eot__ Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
He's playing a stupid joke, sir. __eot__ What? __eot__ We had an argument. He's being silly. __eot__ I swear, I don't know this girl.
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and... __eot__ Will you shut up!?!!
Hopeless. It's hopeless. __eot__ David, let's go now.
Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something! __eot__ David, don't lose control. __eot__ Control!?! What control!?! Get away from me!
Hello, Benjamin. __eot__ No. __eot__ No what? __eot__ No. __eot__ Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this. __eot__ No.
Feeling better? __eot__ No. __eot__ The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos. __eot__ No. __eot__ Right.
How are we feeling tonight? __eot__ No. __eot__ No what? __eot__ No! __eot__ Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck? __eot__ No. __eot__ I thought not.
He all right? __eot__ Yes, I should think. He called out just now. __eot__ He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him. __eot__ Chart says he's from New York. __eot__ I think he's a Jew. __eot__ Why on earth do you say that? __eot__ I looked. __eot__ Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.
Miss Price. __eot__ Yes, Mrs. Hobbs. __eot__ Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that? __eot__ Has he been refusing food? __eot__ Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold. __eot__ Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Officer, I killed those people last night. __eot__ You did, did you?
All right, you two, move along. __eot__ Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me! __eot__ There's no call for that kind of language. __eot__ Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit! __eot__ Now see here young man. __eot__ Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!
Who is this girl? __eot__ You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you. __eot__ That's what I want you to do, you moron!
Why are you doing this to me, Jack? __eot__ This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities. __eot__ Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you. __eot__ You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
That's easy for you to say - you're already dead. __eot__ No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead. __eot__ Why are you doing this to me?
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane? __eot__ No, but we're about to.
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak. __eot__ Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it. __eot__ Oh, come on, tell us. __eot__ No. You've had your chance.
Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations. __eot__ That's very funny, that is.
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here! __eot__ You could have told them!
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please. __eot__ I was having a nightmare.
Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning. __eot__ What time is it? __eot__ It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex. __eot__ Alex? __eot__ Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you. __eot__ What are you going to see? __eot__ An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep. __eot__ Do you have bad dreams, too? __eot__ Some, everyone does. __eot__ Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi? __eot__ Bambi?
Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins. __eot__ Where am I? __eot__ You're in a hospital in London. __eot__ London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream. __eot__ I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences. __eot__ The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London? __eot__ Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.
Miss Price! Miss Price, please! __eot__ Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
How long have I been here? __eot__ You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago. __eot__ Two weeks? __eot__ You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten. __eot__ Lunatic? __eot__ Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
There were witnesses? __eot__ So they said. __eot__ How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about. __eot__ In time I'm sure it will all come back to you. __eot__ Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.
You've never had bad dreams before? __eot__ Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you? __eot__ I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog. __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands. __eot__ You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of. __eot__ Did you see Jack? __eot__ No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here. __eot__ Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb? __eot__ I really don't know. __eot__ Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that. __eot__ David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly. __eot__ You really think I'm crazy, don't you? __eot__ Believe me. The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's. And if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud, a fake.
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself. __eot__ Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
Are you cold? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Good.
Jack. __eot__ David. __eot__ You're not having a good time are you? __eot__ Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
Well, I like it here. __eot__ I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later. __eot__ Right.
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome? __eot__ I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body. __eot__ Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time. __eot__ She's a jerk. __eot__ You're talking about the woman I love. __eot__ I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break. __eot__ Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there? __eot__ I don't know. __eot__ Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared... __eot__ If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you. __eot__ I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really. __eot__ It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull. __eot__ It is impossible for a body like that to be dull. __eot__ We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that? __eot__ She says she 'likes me too much'.
The Slaughtered Lamb? __eot__ Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol? __eot__ That's a wolf's head. __eot__ Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol? __eot__ That's not a spear. It's a pike. __eot__ A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol. __eot__ David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault. __eot__ I assume full responsibility. __eot__ Okay. __eot__ Shall we?
Hello. __eot__ Nice to see you.
Nice looking group. __eot__ Listen, at least it's warm in here. __eot__ Look at that.
What about it? __eot__ It's a five-pointed star. __eot__ Maybe the owners are from Texas.
Ask them what the candles are for. __eot__ You ask them. __eot__ Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man. __eot__ I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters. __eot__ Right. __eot__ Wrong.
Go on, ask them. __eot__ You ask them.
Jack, we'd better go. __eot__ What do you mean? I'm starving.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!! __eot__ Apparently so.
What the hell was that all about? __eot__ I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road. __eot__ Beware the moon? __eot__ Come on, I'm freezing.
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea. __eot__ I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob. __eot__ Well, not quite a blood-thirsty mob.
What do you think was wrong? __eot__ I have no idea. __eot__ Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural. __eot__ I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.
Say, David... __eot__ I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
Did you hear that? __eot__ I heard that. __eot__ What was it?
Could be a lot of things. __eot__ Yeah? __eot__ A coyote. __eot__ There aren't any coyotes in England. __eot__ The Hound of the Baskervilles. __eot__ Pecos Bill. __eot__ Heathcliffe. __eot__ Heathcliffe didn't howl. __eot__ No, but he was on the moors. __eot__ It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb. __eot__ Yeah.
Shit! David, what is that? __eot__ I don't know. Come on. __eot__ Come on, where? __eot__ Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
It's moving. __eot__ It's circling us.
What's the plan? __eot__ Plan? __eot__ Let's just keep walking.
It's in front of us. __eot__ Do you think it's a dog?
Oh shit. What is that? __eot__ A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
Nice doggie. Good boy. __eot__ Walk away, Jack. __eot__ Walking away, yes, sir. Here we are walking away.
See anything? __eot__ No.
It sounds far away. __eot__ Not far enough. Come on.
Jack? __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ Where are we going? __eot__ I'll tell you when we get there. __eot__ Well. I'm glad we... WHOAA!!
You really scared me, you shithead. __eot__ Are you going to help me up?
Nice to see you. __eot__ Get the fuck out of here, Jack. __eot__ Thanks a lot. __eot__ This is too much. I can't handle this. __eot__ I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me.
David! You're hurting my feelings. __eot__ Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger! __eot__ I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come. __eot__ Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace? __eot__ Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came. __eot__ Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person. __eot__ Debbie Klein cried a lot. __eot__ I can't stand it. __eot__ So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed. __eot__ Rudy Levine the shmuck? __eot__ Life mocks me even in death.
I'm going completely crazy. __eot__ David! __eot__ What?! __eot__ David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you. __eot__ Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf? __eot__ I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know. __eot__ If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead! __eot__ We were attacked by a werewolf. __eot__ I'm not listening! __eot__ On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf. __eot__ Shut up, you zombie! __eot__ I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted. __eot__ What's wrong with you? Shut up! __eot__ The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed. __eot__ Will you be quiet?!
It's you, David. __eot__ What?! __eot__ You survived and now you shall continue the curse. __eot__ What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit! __eot__ Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.' __eot__ Stop it, Jack. __eot__ Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days. __eot__ Jack, please go away. Please go away. __eot__ You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night. __eot__ You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue! __eot__ David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins. __eot__ Nurse! __eot__ Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance. __eot__ Nurse! __eot__ The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me. __eot__ Nurse! Oh God! Alex! __eot__ It's cold, David, and I'm so alone. The undead surround me. Have you ever talked to a corpse? It's boring! I'm lonely! Kill yourself, David, before you kill others.
You're not real. __eot__ Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
What are you doing here? __eot__ I wanted to see you. __eot__ Okay, you've seen me. Now go away. __eot__ David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on. __eot__ I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf. __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Get out of here, Jack! __eot__ David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become... __eot__ A monster. I know, I know. __eot__ You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late. __eot__ Jack, are you really dead? __eot__ What do you think? __eot__ I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream. __eot__ You must believe me. __eot__ What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit! __eot__ The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life! __eot__ I will not accept this! Now go away!
Hi, Jack. __eot__ Hi, David.
What can I say, Jack? __eot__ You don't have to say anything. __eot__ Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'? __eot__ If I was still alive, I probably would. __eot__ You look awful. __eot__ Thank you. __eot__ I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it. __eot__ What about the zoo? __eot__ Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack. __eot__ I want you to meet some people.
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly. __eot__ Hello. __eot__ Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway. We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.
Because this must be stopped. __eot__ How shall I do it?
I could hang myself. __eot__ If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
Dr. Hirsch? __eot__ Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
No, thank you, Doctor. __eot__ Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
You were saying? __eot__ Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors? __eot__ Why don't we ask him?
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think... __eot__ Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.
What can we do to assist you? __eot__ Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
Yes? __eot__ Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor. __eot__ Send them in.
Excuse me.  Yes? __eot__ Roger Mathison, Doctor. __eot__ What here? __eot__ He's on the telephone. __eot__ Tell him I'm out. No, tell him I've passed away. An old war wound or something. Tell him I'm dead. And no more calls!
Hello, there. What can I get you? __eot__ Campari and soda would do nicely. __eot__ Sorry, love. __eot__ I suppose Guinness will suffice.
What's that? __eot__ Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it. __eot__ I see. You've heard nothing about the incident?
Do you have any hot soup? __eot__ No.
Hot chocolate? __eot__ We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea. __eot__ Then you have some hot tea? __eot__ No. __eot__ Oh. __eot__ But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
Remember the Alamo? __eot__ I beg your pardon?
No, thank you. __eot__ I'd like some tea, please.
Sorry. __eot__ Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?
He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man. __eot__ Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock. __eot__ Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and... __eot__ And what, Sergeant? __eot__ I don't rightly know, sir. __eot__ That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.
I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We will find him, however. I can assure you of that. __eot__ We'll find him, not to worry.
Hello, Tom. __eot__ You here again? What do you want?
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money! __eot__ Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I? __eot__ I want to know why .
Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest __eot__ I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent. __eot__ But listen, Tom, I
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment. __eot__ She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows. __eot__ Why not?
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I? __eot__ Yes - sure __eot__ Yeah - sure!
Oscar, what's the matter? __eot__ I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet. __eot__ No kidding? __eot__ No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin. __eot__ Where's Matt? __eot__ Matt? __eot__ Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . . __eot__ The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office. __eot__ He has? __eot__ Yeah.
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls. __eot__ How much? __eot__ About twenty-four thousand. __eot__ It was more than that last week. __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ Here's twenty-five thousand.
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie? __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ Let me have ten bucks? __eot__ Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit. __eot__ Charlie! __eot__ Yeah?
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I __eot__ Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
Whose death? __eot__ It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks. __eot__ Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression? __eot__ Aw, nerts!
Where you been? __eot__ Where do you think I've been?  I took the baby for a stroll in the park.
What's the matter, Charlie? __eot__ I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too. __eot__ I remember once when your account checked. __eot__ Yeah.
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning. __eot__ Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
Mr. Dickson in yet? __eot__ Not yet, Mr. Clark. __eot__ When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room. __eot__ Yes, sir. __eot__ And tell him not to delay. __eot__ Yes, sir.
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right. __eot__ Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.
Don't make me laugh, Schultz! __eot__ Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust __eot__ What good will that do? __eot__ What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans! __eot__ Take it easy, Clark.
You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control. __eot__ All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.
Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything __eot__ I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind. __eot__ Oh, you would, eh?  All right. If it's more important than golf, go ahead. What's on your mind?
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking? __eot__ Just pure luck!
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea? __eot__ Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them. __eot__ I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!
I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear! __eot__ Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith! __eot__ Yes! You said it, Clark. That's the only thing that means anything to me.
We want to talk to you. __eot__ What about? __eot__ We'll discuss that in the board room.
We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help? __eot__ What do you mean, help? __eot__ I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes. __eot__ That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes? __eot__ I have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine, isn't it?
The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them? __eot__ Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob. __eot__ No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president. __eot__ So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
Say, you can't do that __eot__ I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank. __eot__ The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this! __eot__ We've been waiting fifteen minutes __eot__ You know what you can do with that! Come on, take a look at this! You'll see a demonstration of faith that's worth more than all the collateral in the world.
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett. __eot__ Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector? __eot__ Where were you at twelve o'clock last night? __eot__ That's very simple. I was home.
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary. __eot__ Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady. __eot__ Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett? __eot__ If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married. __eot__ Oh! __eot__ You understand? __eot__ Why, of course.
Thanks. __eot__ Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree." __eot__ It's one of the boys from headquarters. He always sings "Mother Machree" whenever he's got good news. Looks like this case'll be settled in no time.
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun. __eot__ All right, Jack, all right.
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you. __eot__ Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning? __eot__ They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison! __eot__ Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs. __eot__ I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it! __eot__ Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name. __eot__ He won't believe it, Mr. Dickson. But it's the truth - honest it is. I was in my apartment last night - ask your wife - she
Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you? __eot__ I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson. __eot__ What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people? __eot__ Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars! __eot__ Fifty thousand dollars! __eot__ But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night? __eot__ Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying. __eot__ You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment? __eot__ She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't __eot__ Get out, get out!
You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you? __eot__ I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely! __eot__ That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us. __eot__ I haven't got it.
Then what did you want to gamble for? If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? Well, we want our dough. __eot__ I'm sorry, Dude, butI __eot__ That don't do us any good. __eot__ But after all, you can't take blood from a stone. __eot__ We can take blood from anything   If it's comin' to us.
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I __eot__ Why not? __eot__ Why, I couldn't do that . . . ! __eot__ You don't have to do nothing.
What do you mean? __eot__ All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there? __eot__ You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight. __eot__ know, but __eot__ Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand? __eot__ But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time? __eot__ Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!
This won't do. Not during business hours . . . __eot__ Why, I needed a
What is the matter with you? You're trembling? __eot__ Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . . __eot__ Me? __eot__ Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that. __eot__ For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you . __eot__ Well, you can. You always could. __eot__ Liar! You're just suffering from lack of sleep.
Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks __eot__ What is? __eot__ running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril! __eot__ If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would. __eot__ Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line. __eot__ Line? __eot__ Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women.
Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married. __eot__ But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned. __eot__ Now let me see, what comes next?  Oh yes, I know - what are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Doesn't that come next? __eot__ Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis? __eot__ See, we're getting along famously!
Oh! Oh, no!  I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly. __eot__ Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight!
But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months. __eot__ Well __eot__ Well, what? __eot__ Well, aren't you going to invite me? __eot__ You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends. __eot__ Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway. __eot__ Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death. __eot__ No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me. __eot__ Why are you so anxious? __eot__ Don't you know? __eot__ No. __eot__ I want to be near you!
What? __eot__ Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years? __eot__ Now wait a minute, wait a minute... __eot__ I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson. __eot__ Why, Cyril, you're insane __eot__ No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer __eot__ Cyril!
What's this? __eot__ My apartment. __eot__ I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home. __eot__ Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go. __eot__ No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home. __eot__ What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank? __eot__ No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals  I think I will have a drink. __eot__ Good for you. Come on.
You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class. __eot__ Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife. __eot__ What is that, Mr. Bones?[7] __eot__ A misunderstood bachelor.
And now fair woman, I have you in my power. __eot__ I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache! __eot__ I'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here.
Why, Matt! __eot__ What are you doing here?
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow? __eot__ Yes, sir. __eot__ Let me see your cash book, will you? __eot__ Now? __eot__ Yes, now.
The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important. __eot__ Oh, yeah?
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you. __eot__ I'm listening. __eot__ It's funny - now that I'm here, I don't know just how to go about it.  You see, I kind of expected to find you here alone.
Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning. __eot__ Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson.
I'm not interested in what you think. __eot__ You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble. __eot__ I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion. __eot__ No?  Then maybe you'll understand, Mrs. Dickson. Oh, gee, he's crazy about you. Nobody knows it better than you. If he ever finds out, it'll kill him.
Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business. __eot__ This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this? __eot__ That will be just about enough! Now get out of here! __eot__ I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. __eot__ John, how's your wife this morning? __eot__ Much better this morning, thank you. __eot__ Got a handkerchief?
Excuse me __eot__ Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning? __eot__ I'm feeling fine this morning. __eot__ That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too. __eot__ Thank you!
Shall we let the people come in? __eot__ Of course, let them in! You're late now.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning. __eot__ Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear. __eot__ Hello, darling.
If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man! __eot__ It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you. __eot__ Oooh! That has the earmarks!
What's the matter dear? What have I done now? __eot__ Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight. __eot__ Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all about you. I'm so sorry, dear.
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it. __eot__ But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting. __eot__ I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing. __eot__ Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time. __eot__ The theatre? __eot__ That's what it was you planned, wasn't it? __eot__ Yes, of course. __eot__ You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn __eot__ The girls!  I don't suppose it ever occurred to you that I might go out and find myself an attractive young man . . .
Ho! Ho! Ho! __eot__ Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some. __eot__ Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . . __eot__ Well . . . __eot__ Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that? __eot__ Tomorrow night?
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night. __eot__ Happy now? __eot__ No.
Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night? __eot__ Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . . __eot__ Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment? __eot__ In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
Good morning. __eot__ Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it? __eot__ I don't know. __eot__ Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married? __eot__ Why - well, I __eot__ Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new? __eot__ Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room. __eot__ Directors, eh? Long faces?
Longer. __eot__ I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him. __eot__ Yes, sir.
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it! __eot__ Where is he now? __eot__ In Mr. Sampson's office. __eot__ Now don't you worry about it.
Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can. __eot__ Yes, sir.
You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson? __eot__ Numbers? No, never mind.
Good morning, Helen. __eot__ Good morning. __eot__ Say, I know what's the matter with you. Matt!
Oh! __eot__ Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.
Yes? __eot__ Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you? __eot__ Yes, sir.
Yes? __eot__ Mr. Sampson . . . __eot__ All right. Send him in.
Helen! __eot__ Yes? __eot__ Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone.
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke. __eot__ Good morning, Mr. Dickson. __eot__ Got my letter? __eot__ Yes, thank you. __eot__ Hello, Helen.
Mr. Dickson? __eot__ Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty. __eot__ Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform? __eot__ I haven't any. __eot__ You haven't got a uniform? __eot__ No, sir. __eot__ My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost? __eot__ Why, I don't know. __eot__ You see Sampson. Tell him I sent you. You've got to have a uniform.
Oh, make that uniform blue. __eot__ Yes, sir.
Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh? __eot__ Yes, sir. __eot__ Looks good. How much did it cost? __eot__ I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
It's all right. Thanks. __eot__ And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  Not a bad thought, eh?
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it. __eot__ Sure, I think it's swell. __eot__ Say, come on. Show a little enthusiasm. What's the matter? Are you sick or something? Go on, fake it - even if it isn't real.
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough. __eot__ Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married? __eot__ Well, I __eot__ I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
I already told him I was home. __eot__ There you are.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  Matt, do you realize you're up against something? You're being charged with murder. It's serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn't do it.  But we've got to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where were you last night? __eot__ I can't tell you.
No. I won't. __eot__ You're protecting somebody. __eot__ No, I'm not Mr. Dickson! __eot__ Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were you last night?  Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don't you?
We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late. __eot__ Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night? __eot__ You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson? __eot__ Were you in Cluett's apartment? __eot__ Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means? __eot__ Was Mrs. Dickson there? __eot__ Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is __eot__ Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there? __eot__ Well . . . uh . . . I . . . __eot__ She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know? __eot__ Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and __eot__ All right. That's all.  Please, Matt.
I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away! __eot__ But I haven't . . . __eot__ I don't want to hear any more about it. If you don't get married, I'll fire both of you.
Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week. __eot__ Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson
What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion. __eot__ I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson. __eot__ Why pick on him ? __eot__ It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he? __eot__ Yes.
What time did this thing happen? __eot__ The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09. __eot__ All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he? __eot__ If he can do it, yes. __eot__ Why, certainly he can.  Matt, now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right.
That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now. __eot__ Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.
All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty. __eot__ What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did. __eot__ Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record. __eot__ So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they
Of course it's true - and he knows it. __eot__ Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?
You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man. __eot__ Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years. __eot__ He's just confessed. He's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town.
My wife? What's she got to do with you? __eot__ No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
You're lying! __eot__ Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away. __eot__ You don't want to check up on anybody. I'll do all the checking up. Wait a minute.
Well, Sampson, what is it? __eot__ Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay. __eot__ I'm afraid he's been stalling. __eot__ That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . . __eot__ He says he can't get away in the daytime. __eot__ How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off. __eot__ Yes, sir.
The lobby's half filled now. __eot__ What are you talking about?
They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police. __eot__ All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away. __eot__ We haven't much on hand, you know. If it gets any worse, I hope we don't have to close the doors.
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot. __eot__ Yes, sir.
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy. __eot__ Did you get the case for the securities? __eot__ Yes, sir. __eot__ Mine too? __eot__ Yes, sir. But soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place.
The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads. __eot__ What'll we do? __eot__ I'll talk to them. Listen, go back and tell the boys to stall as much as possible. Tell 'em not to pay any attention to what I said. Tell 'em to verify every signature.
We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour. __eot__ Don't you think I know it?
Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson! __eot__ Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money. __eot__ Yes, sir. __eot__ I hate to do this, but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing yet.
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here. __eot__ Is it safe? __eot__ Absolutely. __eot__ It's his life insurance money, you know.
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right. __eot__ But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please! __eot__ Please, lady. Please be quiet. Everything will be all right.  Open up here, folks. All right, folks, please!
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson. __eot__ Is that busy husband of mine busy? __eot__ He's at a board meeting. __eot__ Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose. __eot__ I'm afraid so. __eot__ Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank? __eot__ No. __eot__ Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you? __eot__ Hardly.
Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me! __eot__ All right.
Hello, Helen! __eot__ Matt, come here! __eot__ Why? __eot__ Come here, honey!
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us! __eot__ Oh, is that so?
What did you do with it? __eot__ With what? __eot__ The ten dollars. __eot__ Oh, ten dollars __eot__ Yes. __eot__ A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
No. __eot__ Oh, you think I'm lying? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar. __eot__ Oh, Matt.
Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand? __eot__ Yeah, swell.
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job? __eot__ Yeah.
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death. __eot__ Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there. __eot__ Well . . . ? __eot__ Well, he was making love to her.
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken. __eot__ I tell you, I saw them!
In Cluett's office? __eot__ Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.
What's keeping you? __eot__ Oh, Charlie again. __eot__ Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you? __eot__ Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6] __eot__ Oh now, don't be silly. __eot__ Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her. __eot__ Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in. __eot__ Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that
Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs. __eot__ All right, dear.
Oh, Matt . . . __eot__ Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help? __eot__ Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore. __eot__ They must have turned him down. __eot__ Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town. __eot__ Sure, they'd turn him down. He ought to know that. I'm going in there and talk to him.
Did you talk to him? __eot__ Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse. __eot__ Mr. Williams . . . __eot__ The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him? __eot__ Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!
Did you say Dude Finlay? __eot__ Yes, why? __eot__ He was in the bank yesterday. __eot__ He was here? __eot__ He came to see Mr. Cluett. __eot__ Are you sure? __eot__ Yes, sir.
What did you find out, Mike? __eot__ I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere. __eot__ Never mind all that. What did you find out? __eot__ He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint. __eot__ Dude Finlay? __eot__ Yes, sir.
Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan? __eot__ Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.
for the rheumatism, you know. __eot__ What time was it, Mrs. Halligan? __eot__ It was late, I know. The Dooley sisters was already in. They work at a show, you know.
What time was it? __eot__ Huh? __eot__ What time did Matt Brown get in? __eot__ Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after __eot__ I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in? __eot__ That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . . __eot__ Was it twelve o'clock?
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause... __eot__ It couldn't have been earlier? __eot__ No. It wasn't earlier because... __eot__ Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet. __eot__ No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one. __eot__ There you are!
Listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it __eot__ That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks.
You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you? __eot__ wasn't anywhere near this place __eot__ Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun? __eot__ I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun! __eot__ You used to carry a gun, didn't you?
Then who changed it? __eot__ I don't know.
So you were home last night? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ What time did you get in? __eot__ Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock. __eot__ Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that? __eot__ Yes.
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . . __eot__ Then where were you?
You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight. __eot__ Okay, Matt.
How are you fixed? __eot__ I'm okay, Matt. __eot__ You've got enough?
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar. __eot__ Yeah, what did he do with his first one? __eot__ Bought himself a pocketbook!
Everybody in? __eot__ I guess so. __eot__ Where's Charlie? __eot__ Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie! __eot__ They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
You can ride like that? __eot__ I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
I think I may just go on to the reservation. __eot__ Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
I couldn't lose him. __eot__ Jim Younger, I told you--
This is healing? __eot__ Sometimes a wound will kill. __eot__ Now you tell us.
Gatling! They've got a Gatling! __eot__ Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
He's smiling. __eot__ Never a good thing.
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty. __eot__ Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something. __eot__ That was two hours ago.
Here's Liberty's favorite son!  I'll never forget what you did, cousin. __eot__ Zee, I'm pleased you came.
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite. __eot__ The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys. __eot__ I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men.
These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad. __eot__ Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
Uhh, yeah it does. __eot__ You stay out of this, Bob.
No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing. __eot__ How? __eot__ Say we bust into a bank. We yell "We're the Younger-James Gang!" People are gonna be thinking, "The younger James Gang? Is there an older James Gang? How come we never heard of the older James gang?" So people are trying to figure that out instead of raising their arms.
We got a problem here, brother? __eot__ Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick. __eot__ What?
This is the best score yet. __eot__ It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to. __eot__ That was because of... the reputation the gang had. __eot__ As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve. __eot__ Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean. __eot__ Leave me alone, Bob.
How'd they -- __eot__ What have you done? __eot__ I ain't done -- __eot__ WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
Bob. I didn't... __eot__ Swear. __eot__ I swear -- __eot__ Swear on Jimmy's grave.
I'm sorry, Cole. __eot__ You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says "Let's ride." __eot__ He's not bad at it. __eot__ It's tougher than it looks.
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you. __eot__ I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
Yesterday. __eot__ Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!
Corn gonna shoot at me? __eot__ Nope. __eot__ Then I love it.
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ... __eot__ ... Will Perry ...
Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay. __eot__ Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.
They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper. __eot__ Oh no... __eot__ He just lost his temper a little.
Damn! __eot__ They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior -- __eot__ The Army can hang him. __eot__ Tomorrow.
Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again. __eot__ Best damn plan I heard all war.
How many of them did he kill? __eot__ Two.
You have no shame. __eot__ Not yet. But I'm hoping.
But if we take their money and supplies... __eot__ Exactly.
All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours. __eot__ Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him. __eot__ We oughta take some of this, give it to our neighbors in Liberty. Lot of people hurting up there.
"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk." __eot__ Hey! __eot__ "Bank officials estimate the loss at fifty thousand dollars."
Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go... __eot__ One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
Beg pardon? __eot__ You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
This is about the "Wanted!" Posters, isn't it. __eot__ Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here... __eot__ You are a fine figure of a man. __eot__ Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole. __eot__ He's been full of vinegar lately. __eot__ He's planning a job. __eot__ What? __eot__ Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble... __eot__ Tell me.
What? __eot__ You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!
What you sayin' boy? __eot__ I think I recognize you. __eot__ How? __eot__ I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
You shut up now, boy. __eot__ No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your --
'Bout time you got here, buddy. __eot__ What's going on?
Ride with me, cousin? __eot__ I could use the walk. __eot__ Suit yourself. We'll have some horses waiting for you at the road.  Let's ride, Rangers!
Where you boys going? __eot__ There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
Home, boys. Back to our farms. __eot__ Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
Hands off your hip, Cole. __eot__ You're not scared, are you? __eot__ Pick your fights, cousin. You taught me that.
Not now. __eot__ What is wrong with you? __eot__ In case we have to kill these sonofabitches, I don't want them to see us coming.
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes? __eot__ She got two of them.
She had a moustache. __eot__ She was European! __eot__ All right, calm down. I'll agree Sadie was a woman --
Thanks for the help. __eot__ After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse? __eot__ The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it. __eot__ It was exciting. __eot__ But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that?
Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns. __eot__ Yeah.
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day. __eot__ So what do we do, General Lee? __eot__ Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they won't care.
I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money. __eot__ Perfect, Cole. __eot__ Let's ride.
The James-Younger Gang. __eot__ Sorry. __eot__ Don't let it happen again.
I got seven thousand. __eot__ I got three.
See, Frank's being smart about this. __eot__ Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
It's not a bank. __eot__ It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job.
"The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men." __eot__ Twenty?!
Jesse, we got to have a word. __eot__ Sure, cousin. __eot__ All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang." __eot__ Yep. __eot__ Why aren't we the "Younger-James Gang"? I mean, there's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here.
This is your fault for hogging all the publicity. __eot__ Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob is an important part of the gang.
It'll be the biggest score yet. __eot__ What will be?
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper. __eot__ If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems. __eot__ What are you saying? __eot__ I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job. __eot__ You're forgetting who's in charge --
Beautiful. __eot__ Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea -- __eot__ A bad idea. __eot__ I got us through the War all right. __eot__ And almost got hanged in peacetime. __eot__ That's it.
I'm the better soldier, Jesse. __eot__ And I'm the better outlaw.
Still smells fishy. __eot__ Then let me run the show, General Lee.
Fine. We hit this bank. __eot__ You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin.  Cole Younger's going to make everybody rich!
Dammit! __eot__ A trap.
Okay, you're gonna rest here. __eot__ Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
Bob, rip up some bandages. __eot__ Pass me some whisky.
We'll make them pay for this. __eot__ I'm out. __eot__ WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?! __eot__ Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
Missed you, cousin. __eot__ Missed you too, cousin.
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought -- __eot__ Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
Where'd you get all these riders? __eot__ We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom. __eot__ You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself! __eot__ You ride like a Comanche.
Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want. __eot__ Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you... __eot__ Well? __eot__ I'm thinking...
Cannon or Gatling? __eot__ Both would be nice. __eot__ Soon as I hit one, the other'll know and beat us up.
What the -- __eot__ Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.
I think one of 'em's glass. __eot__ Which one, right or left? __eot__ The brown one.
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's... __eot__ Sadie was not a man!
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice. __eot__ Shakespeare.  He's European. __eot__ Ah.
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me! __eot__ Get buckets!
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think -- __eot__ Strategically. __eot__ -- Exactly. Because this is a war.
Jesse. __eot__ Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride? __eot__ Cole, he didn't mean that.
Another dozen out back. __eot__ They gonna rush us? __eot__ They're just insurance in case we run.
The safe. Now. __eot__ Of course!  Uh, sir? __eot__ What? __eot__ Where is Jesse James? __eot__ This here is the Younger Gang!
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE! __eot__ All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...
You 'um big lawman? __eot__ Yeah, Injun. What do you want? __eot__ Great Chief of St. Louis send me. __eot__ The District Marshall
Of St. Louis? __eot__ Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock. __eot__ East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass? __eot__ Ho-yah!
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk! __eot__ Me get heap firewater --
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday! __eot__ You're right, sir. __eot__ Then why can't I go in there? __eot__ On account of we're robbing it. __eot__ Oh. Why didn't you just say so? __eot__ It's a secret. __eot__ Fine. I'll just wait here. __eot__ I'd appreciate that.
What the -- __eot__ What is it? __eot__ Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank. __eot__ So? __eot__ When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody?
Where the hell were you? __eot__ I had you covered.  From back there. __eot__ Shit.
-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee. __eot__ My little Web did that? __eot__ Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them.
Web died fighting? __eot__ Died a hero.
Boys... __eot__ Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.
What do you say, sir? __eot__ Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
You know you're welcome any time! __eot__ Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out. __eot__ It's fine by me, Jesse.
Daddy, don't start with this again. __eot__ Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?
He's going to be fine, right Daddy? __eot__ The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.
They're gone. What are you -- __eot__ I fooled them into thinking I was alone. __eot__ Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning. __eot__ I think he's already feeling better.
He thinks this is some kind of game! __eot__ I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck.
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off. __eot__ So we got a plan?
Distracting enough for you? __eot__ Pff. They hardly even noticed you. __eot__ So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention. __eot__ Mm-hmm. __eot__ Such as? __eot__ You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats. __eot__ That would have made an impression. __eot__ I figure. __eot__ See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it. __eot__ No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
Web's dead. __eot__ I reckoned. __eot__ Hell of a war. __eot__ I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
Hello, Liberty Missoura! __eot__ All this time in the saddle... We get to the farm, I'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle.
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got. __eot__ We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
Frank, don't you have something to say? __eot__ You're doing just fine. __eot__ Zee, we got to talk to you and your father.
Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself. __eot__ Saved all our lives, Doc. None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms, Doc. God's honest truth.
All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me. __eot__ Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right. __eot__ What kind of story are they going to believe?
That just might work. __eot__ Maybe, maybe...
"Big and older"? __eot__ You can shut up now. __eot__ You are a charmer. __eot__ I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep. __eot__ Next time try "fat and haggard."
She's still talking to Jesus. __eot__ What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
-- if you stop saying things about my Zee. __eot__ Your Zee? Hmm.  "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."
You know him? __eot__ Heard of him.
I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can. __eot__ Damn. All that reading paid off.
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming? __eot__ What do you think? __eot__ Would you get in the carriage? Until Ma has you home so she can fuss over you herself, she's gonna make me miserable.
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody -- __eot__ Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
Pinkertons. It's the railroad. __eot__ Ma.
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else. __eot__ Don't care. __eot__ Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin. __eot__ Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
How'd it go in there? __eot__ Fine. How'd it go out here? __eot__ We're gonna have to talk...
And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck -- __eot__ And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives. __eot__ And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare? __eot__ It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
Gents, we are in the middle of something here. __eot__ Bob's upset. __eot__ The posters?
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control! __eot__ Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
This has been a good year. __eot__ Jesse, we're outlaws. __eot__ And we're good at it. __eot__ It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now. __eot__ You've killed your fair share of men. __eot__ If I could go back to farming -- __eot__ That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen. __eot__ I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way. __eot__ We're doing this for Ma. __eot__ Maybe it started out that way. But now... __eot__ What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming. __eot__ A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?
We're drunk. __eot__ Oh yeah. __eot__ Just do me a favor. Think about what this is costing everybody. Not just the railroad.
You taking sides against me, now, Frank? __eot__ No, I --
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door. __eot__ Got any ideas, little brother?
Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim. __eot__ Jim was old enough... __eot__ He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that? __eot__ Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him. __eot__ You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know. __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking? __eot__ I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks. __eot__ See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there. __eot__ Hell, they hardly even noticed us.
Y'know, Uncle Frank... __eot__ Yeah, Jimmy? __eot__ ...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot. __eot__ I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.
Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up. __eot__ Sounds like he was a hell of a man. __eot__ That he was. __eot__ They're making him a hero now. __eot__ Saved a lot of folk from the railroad. __eot__ But he killed a lot of men, too. __eot__ Can't argue that. __eot__ So what was he? __eot__ I think... he was just a real interestin' fella to have around.
Uncle Frank? __eot__ Yeah Jimmy? __eot__ How much of that story is true? __eot__ Everything but the boring parts.
Did you kill Yankees? __eot__ A fair number, Ma. __eot__ Say your prayers?
Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend. __eot__ He's a good Christian and he killed Yankees. Jesus told me that made him an all right boy.
Easterners. __eot__ We're just fine, thank you, sir.
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them. __eot__ Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
Ma! Please! __eot__ Boys?
Riders -- __eot__ We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms. __eot__ Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.
Doc Mimms will -- __eot__ Shush.
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms? __eot__ You were little Jesse James when you left. __eot__ But you got big!
But still died. __eot__ If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
Jesse, are you awake? __eot__ Mmmm.
Jesse, is that your hand? __eot__ Nuh-huh ...
You shouldn't be up. __eot__ I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it. __eot__ You're sick of my company? __eot__ No! I mean, of course not. No. __eot__ Teasing you is completely unfair. __eot__ What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean. __eot__ I shouldn't tease a hero. __eot__ What? __eot__ Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero. __eot__ I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day. __eot__ So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger? __eot__ Unfair. You are completely unfair.
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older. __eot__ You didn't want to farm? __eot__ I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate. __eot__ A river pirate. __eot__ Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy. __eot__ Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you? __eot__ Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor. __eot__ You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James? __eot__ Not if I find the right girl. __eot__ And what's this right girl like? __eot__ Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth. __eot__ Where will you find such a girl? __eot__ Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.
Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..." __eot__ Sparkling rocks? __eot__ Little ones. __eot__ Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote? __eot__ Yep. __eot__ Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting? __eot__ I've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time.
I am so sorry, Jesse. __eot__ Frank and me have to go away for a while.
You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this. __eot__ Me neither. __eot__ Let the law -- __eot__ Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does. __eot__ Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop? __eot__ When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.
Zee. __eot__ Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county! __eot__ I had to see you. I'm getting married.
I don't understand. __eot__ She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind. __eot__ That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought... __eot__ She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
I would never have imagined us in a place like this. __eot__ That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here. __eot__ Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement? __eot__ I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time. __eot__ Now wait a minute. There are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding.
Hmm. __eot__ "Hmm" what? __eot__ "But the life of the James Gang wasn't all robbing and shooting and killing, for these young Missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies... especially the handsome and charismatic Jesse James."
I beg your pardon? __eot__ "Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby. __eot__ Let me see that. __eot__ Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm. __eot__ Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you? __eot__ Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy? __eot__ Aw, shucks, ma'am... __eot__ Stop it. This is just sad. __eot__ Swimming. Swimming is good.
Don't turn around. __eot__ What? __eot__ If you don't see it, it's not real...
You get arrested again, I'll kill you. __eot__ Yes ma'am. __eot__ I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you. __eot__ You are a hell of a woman. __eot__ Don't swear. __eot__ Yes ma'am.
Tennessee? __eot__ I'll explain on the way.
We're moving you tomorrow. __eot__ But I like the presidential suite. __eot__ Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers. __eot__ So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains? __eot__ That's the idea.
Did you order our houses burned down? __eot__ Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.
You almost ended my career before it began. __eot__ Pity.
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell? __eot__ Last February? __eot__ Mmm. __eot__ You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive? __eot__ Yes? __eot__ The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town. __eot__ Damn.
Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me. __eot__ I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much. __eot__ No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one.
Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know. __eot__ I figured. __eot__ Was it worth it? __eot__ Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it. __eot__ That's what I would have done. __eot__ I'm not hanged yet. __eot__ You cocky little bastard. __eot__ Ahh, you'll miss me. __eot__ No, I'll hang you.  But I may miss you just a bit.
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else. __eot__ He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee. __eot__ Thanks. __eot__ I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time. __eot__ Fair enough.
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation. __eot__ You don't think God'll mind, do you?
The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James? __eot__ I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your... __eot__ Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth. __eot__ Thank you. __eot__ Who needs to repair a leaky church roof.
Now let's have a drink. __eot__ Right here in church? __eot__ Communion.
And you're too young. __eot__ I'm the same age you were when you went off to war. __eot__ And the same age Web was. No.
I like that. __eot__ No.
You okay, Jesse? __eot__ Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky. __eot__ Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink. __eot__ I guess so. __eot__ I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off and fight with you and Cole. Now it's my turn.
Jim, you been with a girl yet? __eot__ Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
Well, not exactly. __eot__ You been with a girl ever? __eot__ Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know? __eot__ I think so. __eot__ You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse? __eot__ I swear. __eot__ Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up. __eot__ You do that.
What about that Rock Island bastard? __eot__ It's his money.  He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse?
... too young for whisky... __eot__ This time we'll make an exception. __eot__ Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time... __eot__ You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
Why, yeah. __eot__ I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name. __eot__ Oh, you were talking to Jesse. __eot__ Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
Really? __eot__ I hope I'm not being too forward. __eot__ Not at all. __eot__ I just though you were awful cute. __eot__ Thank you, Miss -- ? __eot__ Lyla Devereux. __eot__ Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink? __eot__ Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here. __eot__ Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk? __eot__ That is so gentlemanly of you.
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once. __eot__ Really? __eot__ Don't talk about it much, though.
Well, this land is about to be condemned. __eot__ I'm doing you folks a favor --
Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate. __eot__ It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time. __eot__ They had to be dealt with! __eot__ By burning down their homes?
How can that be? __eot__ They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
There's only four of them... __eot__ Move you fools!
Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field. __eot__ And it is my pleasure to be here. __eot__ Really! __eot__ NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen! __eot__ I can completely understand your distress, sir.
Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order. __eot__ Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers. __eot__ Good. __eot__ Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident. __eot__ Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers. __eot__ Yes sir. __eot__ Just perfect. __eot__ A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers. __eot__ You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity. __eot__ I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight. __eot__ I'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress.
They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile. __eot__ How much did they get from the safe? __eot__ Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track -- __eot__ I'll kill them for blowing up my railway! __eot__ To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks. __eot__ THEN WHO DID?! __eot__ We did.
Your men knew the risks. __eot__ What is going on here, man?
With my money! __eot__ We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
The final route for the railroad is complete. __eot__ I look forward to seeing it.
Parker. __eot__ Sir? __eot__ What is that? __eot__ What, sir?
That. __eot__ Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
This is him. __eot__ I remember you.
How did you know? __eot__ Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least. __eot__ Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
You wouldn't have done that? __eot__ Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too. __eot__ I want them arrested and hanged! __eot__ Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains. __eot__ This is no game. __eot__ I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
"A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West." __eot__ It is a nice piece of writing. __eot__ "The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!"  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month! __eot__ Oh, that's the best part.
It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns. __eot__ I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers! __eot__ Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create. __eot__ So you can't tell me anything? __eot__ It's going to be a long winter.
Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses. __eot__ All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning.
First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs. __eot__ I can't believe this. __eot__ And there are some towns in Missouri where James and his men can walk openly, as heroes.
Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side. __eot__ I demand action. __eot__ No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it? __eot__ Can't you tell me anything? __eot__ It's going to be a long spring.
So he's won. __eot__ No.
Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends. __eot__ In English, Pinkerton. __eot__ There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed. __eot__ Can you put men at all four? __eot__ No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank. __eot__ What is that? __eot__ Why, their intense hatred of you, of course.
What the hell is that sound? __eot__ Vengeance.
Listen, what are you doing tonight? __eot__ What? Oh, I'm...busy. __eot__ Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight? __eot__ Stop it. I'm... __eot__ On a lot of lithium? __eot__ Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick. __eot__ You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when? __eot__ Am I confused or were we talking about tonight? __eot__ Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that. __eot__ Pumpkin? __eot__ Yes? __eot__ Pumpkin you're dating an asshole. __eot__ Uh huh. __eot__ Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York. __eot__ I know. Stop it. __eot__ Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed. __eot__ Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go. __eot__ Courtney? Dinner? __eot__ I can't. __eot__ I'm thinking Dorsia. __eot__ Dorsia's nice. __eot__ Nice? __eot__ You like it there, don't you? __eot__ The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight. __eot__ Okay. Yeah. What time? __eot__ Eight? __eot__ Pick me up? __eot__ Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish. __eot__ Is that Donald Trump's car? __eot__ Oh God, Patrick. Shut up. __eot__ You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump. __eot__ I just want to have a child. Just...two... perfect...children...
J&B. Straight. __eot__ Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up. __eot__ Are we here? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ This is Dorsia? __eot__ Yes, dear.
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely. __eot__ Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
Luis is a despicable twit. __eot__ Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me. __eot__ Is it a what? __eot__ Pull out. __eot__ I'm ignoring you. __eot__ Pull out, goddamnit! __eot__ What do you want, Courtney?
It's a plain end. I think. __eot__ Turn the light on.
Oh Jesus. I'm going home. __eot__ Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light. __eot__ It's a plain end, see? So? __eot__ Take it off. __eot__ Why? __eot__ Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip   to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate! __eot__ Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch? __eot__ Oh God, just get it over with.
Will you call me before Thanksgiving? __eot__ Maybe.
What are you doing tonight? __eot__ Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe. __eot__ That's nice. __eot__ You and...Luis? __eot__ We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is... __eot__ I never knew you smoked. __eot__ You never noticed.
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk? __eot__ You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less. __eot__ Isn't that special?  Patrick? __eot__ Yes, Courtney?
Patrick? __eot__ Yes? __eot__ Nothing.
I haven't seen you around here. __eot__ You just haven't been looking. __eot__ Would you like to see my apartment?
Do you want to come to my apartment or not? __eot__ I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception. __eot__ Do you take American Express?
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it? __eot__ Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time... __eot__ Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise. __eot__ I don't think so.
Nothing like last time, promise. __eot__ Alright.
So, you're looking great, how have you been? __eot__ Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time. __eot__ Really? __eot__ My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer. __eot__ Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.
This is nicer than your other apartment. __eot__ It's not that nice.
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it. __eot__ Do...what. __eot__ Get married. Have a wedding. __eot__ Evelyn? __eot__ Yes, darling? __eot__ Is your Evian spiked? __eot__ We should do it. __eot__ No-I can't take the time off work. __eot__ Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly. __eot__ I don't want to talk about it. __eot__ Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work. __eot__ Because I...want...to...fit...in.
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist. __eot__ Hi. Pat Bateman.
Why don t you just go for Price? __eot__ Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price? __eot__ He's rich. __eot__ Everybody's rich. __eot__ He's good-looking. __eot__ Everybody's good-looking, Patrick. __eot__ He has a great body __eot__ Everybody has a great body now.
Are you using minoxidil? __eot__ No. I'm not. Why should I ? __eot__ Your hairline looks like it's receding. __eot__ It's not.
I want a firm commitment. __eot__ I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
Why? What's wrong? __eot__ My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.
We need to talk. __eot__ Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about? __eot__ It's over, Evelyn. It's all over __eot__ Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee? __eot__ I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore. __eot__ But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip. __eot__ I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about that. You can have them.
You're really serious, aren't you? __eot__ Yes, I am. __eot__ But what about the past? Our past? __eot__ We never really shared one. __eot__ You're inhuman. __eot__ I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  You're just not terribly important to me.
No, no, no. __eot__ I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now. __eot__ Oh God, I can't believe this. __eot__ I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.
Where are you going? __eot__ I'm just leaving. __eot__ But where? __eot__ I have to return some videotapes.
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress . __eot__ What are the rules for a sweater vest?
Picked them up from the printers yesterday __eot__ Good coloring. __eot__ That's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.
Eggshell with Romalian type.  What do you think? __eot__ Nice.
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman? __eot__ I know her. I knew her.
Because he dated her. __eot__ How did you guess? __eot__ Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman. __eot__ Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women? __eot__ Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar? __eot__ No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was an interesting guy.
Listen, what about dinner? __eot__ Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
Are you my two o'clock? __eot__ No.
Can I help you? __eot__ I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
Doesn't he live here? __eot__ No, he doesn't. __eot__ Are you sure? __eot__ You saw the ad in the Times? __eot__ No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here? __eot__ There was no ad in the Times.
I think you should go now. __eot__ But I think...I want to know what happened here. __eot__ Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
Don't come back. __eot__ I won't...don't worry.
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously. __eot__ Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it? __eot__ Yes, naturally. __eot__ Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s fabulous. That's rich...
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it? __eot__ What exactly do you mean? __eot__ The message you left.
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right? __eot__ But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
Carnes? Wait. __eot__ Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer. __eot__ What are you talking about? Bateman is what? __eot__ Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must... __eot__ Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true. __eot__ Excuse me. I really must he going. __eot__ No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer __eot__ But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore. __eot__ It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible? __eot__ It's just not. __eot__ Why not, you stupid bastard?
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago. __eot__ No, you...didn't? __eot__ Now, if you'll excuse me.
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there? __eot__ Lucky, I guess. __eot__ That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture? __eot__ Uh huh. __eot__ It looks so soft. __eot__ Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
Patrick? Is that you? __eot__ No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken. __eot__ This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag? __eot__ Commes des Garcon.
Call me please, Patrick. __eot__ Jesus lives, Luis.
What...is...it? __eot__ Where are you going? __eot__ I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes. __eot__ Patrick? __eot__ What? CARRUTHERS  I'll call you.
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out? __eot__ It looks that way, doesn't it?
That's Paul Owen. __eot__ That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy- __eot__ I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus. __eot__ Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it? __eot__ Maybe it's just the light. __eot__ Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God... __eot__ What? __eot__ It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay. __eot__ I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran.
SHUT UP! __eot__ Calm down. Let's do it anyway __eot__ I guess you're right...  THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S OKAY!
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand. __eot__ Like what? __eot__ Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.
What's that, a gram? __eot__ New card. What do you think?
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine. __eot__ But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white... __eot__ Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel. __eot__ Ask me a question.
I'm leaving. I'm getting out. __eot__ Leaving what? __eot__ This.
Don't, I'll drink it. __eot__ Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving. __eot__ Where to? Are you going to go get a gram? __eot__ I'm leaving! I...am...leaving! __eot__ Don't tell me...merchant banking? __eot__ No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing. __eot__ Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about? __eot__ I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
Dorsia. __eot__ Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight? __eot__ Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.
Dorsia, yes? __eot__ Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
We are totally booked. __eot__ Oh really? That's great. __eot__ I said we are totally booked. __eot__ Two at nine? Perfect. __eot__ There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked. __eot__ See you then.
Late? __eot__ Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages? __eot__ Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why. __eot__ I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else? __eot__ And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17. __eot__ When? __eot__ After six. __eot__ Negative. Cancel it.
Oh? And what should I say? __eot__ Just...say...no. __eot__ Just say no?
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right? __eot__ Yes, sir.
Oh, something. . romantic? __eot__ No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks. __eot__ I'll do it. __eot__ No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay? __eot__ You look nice today.
Yes? __eot__ Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again. __eot__ Ummm...what? I didn't hear you. __eot__ I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something.
You don't like this, I take it? __eot__ Come on, you're prettier than that. __eot__ Thanks, Patrick.
What is it? __eot__ Patrick? __eot__ Ye-es, Je-an? __eot__ Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you. __eot__ Who? __eot__ Detective Donald KIMBALL?
Tell him I'm at lunch. __eot__ Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty.
Patrick? __eot__ Can you bring Mr...
Yes, Patrick? __eot__ Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
Jean? __eot__ Yes, Patrick? __eot__ Would you like to accompany me to dinner?
That is...if you're not doing anything. __eot__ Oh no. I have no plans. __eot__ Well, isn't this a coincidence.
Anywhere you want? __eot__ Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want. __eot__ Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision. __eot__ No, come on. Anywhere you want. __eot__ Oh, I can't.  I don't know. __eot__ Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go... __eot__ Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want. __eot__ Dorsia is...fine.
Yes? You're dressed...okay. __eot__ You didn't give them a name. __eot__ They know me.
Jean? Sorbet? __eot__ Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
Want a bite? __eot__ I'm on a diet. But thank you. __eot__ You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit. __eot__ You can always he thinner. Look...better. __eot__ Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower. __eot__ No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay? __eot__ Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure.
Do you have a boyfriend? __eot__ No, not really. __eot__ Interesting. __eot__ Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously? __eot__ Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun. __eot__ Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life? __eot__ Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing. __eot__ Growing. I'm glad you said that.
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this? __eot__ Who's Ted Bundy? __eot__ Forget it. __eot__ What's that? __eot__ Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun. __eot__ Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?
What...No! Put it in the carton. __eot__ Sorry. __eot__ Jean? What? __eot__ Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special. __eot__ Hmmmm.
Yes. I don t think I can...control myself. __eot__ I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go?
If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you.  You don't want to get hurt, do you? __eot__ No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. You're right, I should go.
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21. __eot__ Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.
Patrick Bateman's office. __eot__ Jean? Hello? Jean? __eot__ Patrick? Is that you? __eot__ Hello? Jean, I need help! __eot__ Where are you? __eot__ Jean-I'm not- __eot__ Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks. __eot__ Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch? __eot__ Patrick? I can't hear you. __eot__ What are I doing? __eot__ Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong? __eot__ I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.
...to the office this afternoon. __eot__ Why? __eot__ Just...say...no! __eot__ What is it, Patrick? Are you alright? __eot__ Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!
So, what do you do? __eot__ What do you think I do? __eot__ A model? An actor? __eot__ No. Flattering, but no. __eot__ Well... __eot__ I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
Welt...it depends, why? __eot__ Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes. __eot__ That's...that's too bad. __eot__ You think I'm dumb, don't you? __eot__ What? __eot__ You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb. __eot__ No. I really don't. __eot__ That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you. __eot__ Hello
Well. __eot__ Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best. __eot__ Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere.
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup? __eot__ Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate. __eot__ Listen, if you could talk to them  I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.
Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right? __eot__ Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... Victoria? __eot__ Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often. __eot__ Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time. __eot__ Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday? __eot__ Next Saturday? __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matinée of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you. __eot__ Okay. Do.
What do you mean, she was a hot number. __eot__ If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?
She's my...cousin. __eot__ Uh huh? __eot__ She's from...France.
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning. __eot__ He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours. __eot__ Don't tell him you're here. __eot__ Why would I?
This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at- __eot__ You're at Paul Owen s. __eot__ Who? __eot__ Paul Owen. __eot__ I want the number, idiot.  Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my hairdresser on you.
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours? __eot__ No. __eot__ Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free. __eot__ Patrick, you re a lunatic. __eot__ Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive? __eot__ Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation. __eot__ Come on. I think it would be a turn-on. __eot__ Does he do this all the time?
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl? __eot__ No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that? __eot__ Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing. __eot__ Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening. __eot__ You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in...  Just joking...  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it.  Sorry about that. __eot__ No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important? __eot__ Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip.
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL __eot__ Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you. __eot__ I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well, you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get.
So, what's the topic of discussion? __eot__ I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen. __eot__ You're not with the FBI or anything, are you? __eot__ Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator. __eot__ Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes. __eot__ So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself- __eot__ Coffee? __eot__ No. I'm okay. __eot__ Perrier? San Pellegrino? __eot__ No, I'm okay.
KIMBALL. __eot__ Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle- __eot__ Oh no, I'm okay. __eot__ It's no problem
Well, what's the topic of discussion? __eot__ The disappearance of Paul Owen. __eot__ Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on "Page Six" at least. __eot__ I think his family wants this kept quiet. __eot__ Understandable.  Lime? __eot__ No, really. I'm okay. __eot__ You sure? I can always get you a lime.
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay? __eot__ Shoot. __eot__ How old are you? __eot__ Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October. __eot__ Where did you go to school? __eot__ Harvard. The Harvard Business School. __eot__ Your address? __eot__ Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building. __eot__ Nice. Very nice. __eot__ Thanks.
Pardon me, but are you okay? __eot__ Who do you ask? __eot__ You seem...nervous.
Bad habit. __eot__ I know. I'm sorry.
Would you rather I not smoke? __eot__ No, I guess it's okay. __eot__ You sure? __eot__ No problem.
What can you tell me about Paul Owen? __eot__ Well...
How well did you know him? __eot__ I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know. __eot__ Yale thing?
Yeah...Yale thing. __eot__ What do you mean...Yale thing?
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen? __eot__ He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet. __eot__ What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given. __eot__ I hope I'm not being cross-examined here. __eot__ Do you feel that way? __eot__ No. Not really. __eot__ Where did Paul hang out? __eot__ Hang...out? __eot__ Yeah. You know...hang out. __eot__ Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places. __eot__ He had a yacht? __eot__ No, he just hung out there. __eot__ And where did he go to school?
Don't you know this? __eot__ I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
Anything else you can tell me about Owen? __eot__ We were both seven in 1969. __eot__ So was I. __eot__ Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints? __eot__ Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London. __eot__ Well, maybe he did, huh? __eot__ His girlfriend doesn't think so. __eot__ But...has anyone seen him in London? __eot__ Actually, yes. __eot__ Hmmm. __eot__ Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so... __eot__ Oh. __eot__ Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship? __eot__ What? __eot__ I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts- __eot__ Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and- __eot__ Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.
Have you consulted a psychic? __eot__ No. __eot__ Had his apartment been burglarized? __eot__ No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it. __eot__ I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right? __eot__ No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything. __eot__ That's so typical, isn't it? __eot__ It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then... __eot__ Nothing. __eot__ People just...disappear. __eot__ The earth just opens up and swallows people. __eot__ Eerie. Really eerie.
You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes. __eot__ Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late? __eot__ Uh, no. There's one...down here. __eot__ Oh really? I didn't know that.
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all... __eot__ Absolutely, I'm 100% with you. __eot__ Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don. __eot__ Don. __eot__ So...you hang out here a lot? __eot__ Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" __eot__ 0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli? __eot__ Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump. __eot__ Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
I mean they want to get caught. __eot__ Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence. __eot__ Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect? __eot__ Not really.
Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance?  Which was on the twentieth of December? __eot__ God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.
I had a date with a girl named Veronica. __eot__ Wait. That's not what I've got. __eot__ What? __eot__ That's not the information I've received. __eot__ Well...I...Wait...What information have you received? __eot__ Let's see...  That you were with- __eot__ Well, I could he wrong. __eot__ Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen? __eot__ We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's.
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman. __eot__ Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered. __eot__ Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information? __eot__ Great, yes, I'd like that. __eot__ And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier. __eot__ Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers. __eot__ Not a big music fan, eh? __eot__ No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me. __eot__ Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations. __eot__ I'll be there.
No hash browns? __eot__ Not in the mood, I guess. __eot__ But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before? __eot__ Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them. __eot__ Suit yourself, I guess.
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did? __eot__ I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet? __eot__ I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up. __eot__ But how? Where do you place Paul that night? __eot__ According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam. __eot__ And? __eot__ I've questioned him. __eot__ Marcus? __eot__ Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure. __eot__ But Marcus denied it? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Well, does Marcus have an alibi? __eot__ Yes.
He does? You're sure? __eot__ I checked it out. It's clean. __eot__ Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? __eot__ Where was Marcus? __eot__ He wasn't with Paul Owen. __eot__ So who was he with? __eot__ He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner and   - you.
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night. __eot__ Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?
I'm so hungry. __eot__ It's cold out, too, isn't it? __eot__ I'm so hungry. __eot__ Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job? __eot__ I lost my job... __eot__ Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job?
Gee, uh, that's too bad. __eot__ I'm so hungry.
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job? __eot__ I'm not... __eot__ You're not what? Qualified for anything else? __eot__ I'm hungry __eot__ I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you. __eot__ I'm hungry. __eot__ Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work? __eot__ What am I gonna do? __eot__ Listen, what's your name? __eot__ Al. __eot__ Speak up. Come on. __eot__ Al. __eot__ Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you. __eot__ You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell. __eot__ Shhhh...it's okay. __eot__ Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold. __eot__ Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God. __eot__ I can't...I can't find a shelter __eot__ You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that?  Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot. Al...I'm sorry.
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you? __eot__ I've been great. And you?
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus? __eot__ It's...it's...all right. __eot__ Really? That's interesting.  Not great? __eot__ Oh well, you know. __eot__ And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl. __eot__ Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here. __eot__ Yeah, well, you're late. __eot__ Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello. __eot__ We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table. __eot__ Nobody goes there anymore.
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it? __eot__ I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight? __eot__ Cecelia is, well...you know __eot__ Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork. __eot__ Another Martini, Paul?
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check. __eot__ Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap? __eot__ No, man. I'm gonna bail. __eot__ Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
You like Huey Lewis and the News? __eot__ They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
Hey, Halberstam? __eot__ Yes, Owen? __eot__ Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something? __eot__ No, Owen. __eot__ Is that a raincoat? __eot__ Yes, it is.
You think so? __eot__ You'll look like you consciously worked for the look. __eot__ Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.
How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit? __eot__ What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere. __eot__ I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so... out of it. So...undangerous.
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it? __eot__ Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
Is it over? __eot__ They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs. __eot__ You are a fanatic. __eot__ 'Gonna wait outside.
Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me. __eot__ "Make" him? __eot__ You know what I mean.
I'm just screwed. __eot__ You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool. __eot__ You don't wanna move, do you? __eot__ I can paint anywhere.
I can't help it. I feel like they'd do anything to keep their -- __eot__ Anything? That's not even credible. If he wants to go up there? To check it out? I think you should encourage him.  It's his life. But everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object. You're hurting your own case.
I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff. __eot__ C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times.
A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they -- __eot__ Then you've gotta ask him about that.
It's important. __eot__ If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway. __eot__ Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad.
When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest. __eot__ But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too. __eot__ I think that's great, Milo. I do. __eot__ ...But? __eot__ Didn't you visit the campus? __eot__ I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide. __eot__ No way. You have this -- destiny. __eot__ C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating -- __eot__ Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die? __eot__ You saved my life in alot of ways.
When's Brian coming for the TV? __eot__ Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
That took some fun out of -- __eot__ We're not gonna let it.
You know he's never been anybody's counselor before? __eot__ Milo! What about --?
To our new life.  ...What's wrong? __eot__ That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me. __eot__ He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, "Did you really do this just today?" Cause I was impressed. He said "What're you implying?"
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly. __eot__ What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it? __eot__ That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire.  'Not saying it makes sense.
He's your boss. He's not your -- __eot__ I know, I know. __eot__ If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor. __eot__ Isn't that -- extreme? __eot__ What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it.
I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much -- __eot__ You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
What! __eot__ Teddy was killed last night. __eot__ What're you -- what? __eot__ It was a hate crime.
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case. __eot__ I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys. __eot__ I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that. __eot__ I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing. __eot__ They hack into people's programs? __eot__ Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top. __eot__ You're scaring me. I think we should just go. __eot__ Go where? You can't get away from people like this. __eot__ "Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about. __eot__ You think I don't know that? __eot__ Milo. Why would he -- __eot__ How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there. __eot__ Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and -- __eot__ It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there. __eot__ Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards -- __eot__ I can't just walk away! __eot__ You can't just walk in, either. __eot__ They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five. __eot__ Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me. __eot__ ...Whaddo I do? __eot__ So you believe me?
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there? __eot__ Nothing. __eot__ Nothing?
It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back. __eot__ ...Why? __eot__ Remember Lyle Barton?
The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when -- __eot__ I remember. __eot__ After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary. __eot__ Guilt? __eot__ If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened. __eot__ Poor baby. You know that's not true.
That was -- different. __eot__ ...Different?
Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me. __eot__ Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.  To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you...
Look at this. __eot__ What? __eot__ Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you. __eot__ He has thousands of employees, Milo -- __eot__ It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited -- __eot__ Milo -- __eot__ I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself. __eot__ Milo, you --
Are you gonna tell me where you went? __eot__ I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you.  You know I'm clueless, without you. You know I -- __eot__ Just shut up?
Great! __eot__ Look at me! I'm gonna change.
You look beautiful. __eot__ Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss. __eot__ ...What? __eot__ I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
Milo? __eot__ Don't we have any chopsticks? __eot__ Oh, right. Hold on.
Here we go. __eot__ Great.
...wanna savor this. __eot__ It's gonna get cold. __eot__ Right. Wait. A toast. __eot__ You're just afraid to eat it.
'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department? __eot__ No. __eot__ Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you? __eot__ He'll tell me when he gets home. __eot__ That'll be a test, won't it? __eot__ Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something. __eot__ Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo. __eot__ Prick.
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that cliché about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes. __eot__ He wasn't acting? __eot__ I don't think he knows how.
Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant. __eot__ Right... What's that mean again? __eot__ Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do. __eot__ It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something... __eot__ Like I said: shot in the dark.
Mr. Barton, do you remember me? __eot__ ...It's -- Milo, isn't it? __eot__ Yes sir. I need to talk to you. __eot__ Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.
Milo? __eot__ Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me. __eot__ Have a seat.
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset. __eot__ I am. I am, sir.
Milo? __eot__ My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley. __eot__ My goodness. __eot__ It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they? __eot__ If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first. __eot__ I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis. __eot__ Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area. __eot__ 'Just didn't know who else to talk to. __eot__ And Outpost? You're happy there? __eot__ Yes sir.
You're living here? __eot__ 'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me? __eot__ Sure, I'll see what I can do.
Well I parked illegally. See y'later? __eot__ 'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner. __eot__ You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show. __eot__ Brian! You wanna be a big deal, don't you? That's your dream in life.
Will I get to work for Outpost? __eot__ No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost. __eot__ What? __eot__ What'd they ever do for you?
Okay. __eot__ Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door -- __eot__ What?! __eot__ Wanna be a part of history?
You're interfaced with our dish. __eot__ Gimme the coordinates?
Is it your software? __eot__ Is it your dish?
What?! __eot__ He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
...When did you know? __eot__ You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.
That's gotta kill him, right? __eot__ Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally. __eot__ Outpost doesn't own em.
Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line. __eot__ That'd change with a criminal indictment. __eot__ There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished. __eot__ Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy? __eot__ Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world. __eot__ And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood. __eot__ Milo. Surprised he's not your guest. __eot__ We tried! __eot__ You better believe everybody's trying to sign him up.
Milo? I'm Danny. __eot__ Oh hi.
'Couldn't convince Teddy to come? __eot__ He's pretty tight with his family. __eot__ We could move 'em up here. __eot__ He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything.
Who's that? __eot__ I think they call him the "Houseman." 'Cause "guard" sounds too weird.
...Hello? __eot__ Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you. __eot__ You would? Wow. When would we come?  'Think he hung up.
Cool! __eot__ Would you like a Coke or something? __eot__ Oh. No thanks.
You know a lot about art, I guess. __eot__ There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room.  It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up. __eot__ Low enough to relay internet traffic. __eot__ Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky? __eot__ Skywire.
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges. __eot__ It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it? __eot__ You'd have to start practically from scratch. But this is all you'd be working on. No marketing meetings, no product seminars. We can't waste the time. Half the Valley's working on convergence. So're media conglomerates, cable companies, phone companies. 'Can't finish second, Milo. There is no second... Now what would you like to ask me?
When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 -- __eot__ I do! __eot__ Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100 in cyber-years. I look at you and see the things that got me here.  But somehow got away.
No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself. __eot__ Okay. I'm Gary.
'Think I should buy some originals? __eot__ ...Do I? __eot__ Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions. __eot__ That's insane. You're ahead of your time. __eot__ That's what I told her. My wife.
Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden. __eot__ Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before?  It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  In a tree.
How's it going? __eot__ Maybe I'm going too fast. __eot__ Too fast? At least four companies're on the verge of workable convergence systems, Milo, they --
It's okay. Really. __eot__ Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
You did this -- overnight? __eot__ You're making me young again.
Milo. What's up? __eot__ Well -- you sent for me. __eot__ Right... Right.
You really wrote this just today? __eot__ What're you implying. __eot__ Nothing!
Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead? __eot__ I'm sure. __eot__ The purpose of this company isn't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath. But the software business is binary: you're a zero or a one. Being obsessive isn't a crime. It's a character trait.
It scales, don't you think? __eot__ Definitely.
I heard what happened. __eot__ Were the flags for Teddy?
Had you talked to him much lately? __eot__ Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure. __eot__ Did you? __eot__ Talk about work? Never! __eot__ I meant did you find other stuff to -- __eot__ Oh. Yeah. __eot__ You've been coming in early. __eot__ It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  'Don't know what I'd do without her.
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there... __eot__ 34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place. __eot__ The wrong place? __eot__ The answer's not in the box. It's in the band.
Gary, hi. __eot__ You look a little tired. __eot__ I'm okay. It's going well! __eot__ 'Have a look? __eot__ Sure.
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid. __eot__ ...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again. __eot__ What would you tell the kids? At your new school? You had to come up with a good story, right?
No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse. __eot__ ...Worse? __eot__ Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one. __eot__ Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.
That's great! Thanks. __eot__ 'Sorry about the late notice...
"Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice..."  You left my party to send E-mail? __eot__ I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.
You could've handwritten it. __eot__ I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties. __eot__ Oh, that's right. You're "clueless."
Gary, I -- __eot__ You see what's hanging on the wall?
I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are. __eot__ I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software. __eot__ I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
This is good. Who did it? __eot__ 'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac. __eot__ Maybe we should all get on it.
What'd the girl say? __eot__ There may be a little less trust after your outburst.
Hasn't affected his work, though. __eot__ Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate. __eot__ Gary, don't worry, we -- __eot__ Just do what I'm asking!
Okay, #2. __eot__ Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
Ready for number three? __eot__ Let's go. __eot__ Longitude 109 -- __eot__ Wait... He knows. __eot__ What? __eot__ 'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12. __eot__ Gary? __eot__ Just do it.
All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools. __eot__ In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.
I think you should go. __eot__ You do? __eot__ I mean, it's your life.
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and -- __eot__ You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you. __eot__ Just thought his work should go on. __eot__ He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means? __eot__ It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up. __eot__ Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style. __eot__ Those really weird, short lines.
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water. __eot__ We'll come up with the next big thing. __eot__ ...You wanna work -- here? __eot__ Got out of my other commitment.
You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay? __eot__ Cool.
Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused? __eot__ Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in? __eot__ Not yet. 'Love to bust my ass cause I'm not in frigging Mensa.  I swear to God, it's that kid Milo, I told 'em so in the first place, but they didn't even wanna hear about it.  Let's run a printout on card entries.
Every entry was authorized. __eot__ Keep looking. __eot__ What're we looking for? __eot__ Any irregularity in the pattern.
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time. __eot__ Let's get him in here.
Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here, anyway? __eot__ They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.
You calling Phil and Randy? __eot__ I'm calling Gary.
Come with me. __eot__ Where we going?
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit! __eot__ I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
Lisa. __eot__ You know my name. __eot__ You know mine. __eot__ You're famous around here. __eot__ I'm getting a teacher's pet rep. __eot__ I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets. __eot__ ...Were you? __eot__ We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers. __eot__ Me too! Were you an Army brat or something? __eot__ ...Something like that. Yeah. __eot__ Didn't mean to pry. I just have this theory. Some of us who got to good at this? We were -- escaping something.
Did I say something? __eot__ No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
What've you got there? __eot__ Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you. __eot__ Show me.
Cool! __eot__ Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --
Did you wanna be alone? __eot__ No. Please.
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going? __eot__ "There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor? __eot__ Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower. __eot__ Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code? __eot__ Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway. __eot__ You're compulsive. __eot__ Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people. __eot__ Why's that? __eot__ Long story. Not that interesting.
So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now? __eot__ Then and now.  But not right now.
That's great. I -- didn't know. __eot__ She saved my life.
I snuck into #21. __eot__ Why would you do a thing like -- __eot__ You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care. __eot__ The Day Care?
It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there. __eot__ But why would they --? __eot__ You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make "sense." I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much.
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you. __eot__ Oh yeah?
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me. __eot__ They'd frame him. __eot__ He's out of prison? __eot__ They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."
...Milo? __eot__ Hmm? __eot__ I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean. __eot__ No, no. Never.
What about the FBI? __eot__ They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over. __eot__ Who can we trust? __eot__ There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.
Do we post it on the Net? __eot__ There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine. __eot__ Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick. __eot__ We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home. __eot__ Certainly not at my happy home.
He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire. __eot__ What about "60 Minutes." __eot__ Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001." __eot__ But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like -- __eot__ Say there's just one "mole" working there, like Barton at the DOJ. How do we know he's not the guy we've contacted? Or she? Or the guy she works for?
Time? __eot__ Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!
How close are you? __eot__ What? __eot__ He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this --  mega-network for Skywire. Let's use it.
We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet. __eot__ A what? __eot__ It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away. __eot__ But they'd still get the idea, right? __eot__ You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you? __eot__ It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work. __eot__ Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast. __eot__ Before they kill somebody else, too. __eot__ Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions. __eot__ You mean -- break in? __eot__ I don't know -- __eot__ And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
Why were you so careless? __eot__ I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally?
Why were you snooping in my office? __eot__ Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are? __eot__ 'Cause their apartments might be bugged?
I told Teddy about you. __eot__ What'd he say? __eot__ "A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into -- __eot__ Gary.
Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there. __eot__ The dishes are juiced up, too. __eot__ Thank God. __eot__ Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts. __eot__ They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own. __eot__ He doesn't know about the Day Care. __eot__ Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf? __eot__ Yeah, that's old, in a tree. __eot__ Oh. __eot__ Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described. __eot__ Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to -- __eot__ You could always say you have to go the bathroom. __eot__ That's lame, isn't it? __eot__ You'll come up with something.
Does he know you know? __eot__ He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour. __eot__ Why?! __eot__ She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't. __eot__ Please don't go. __eot__ At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
Meet me at the other location. __eot__ Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop? __eot__ It's three years old, it -- __eot__ Bring it to the other location. __eot__ But you said the other --
Maybe it's the satellite. __eot__ Let's try #2.
...He knows. __eot__ What? __eot__ He's been altering the coordinates since we logged on. He's a step ahead. Let's jump to #12.
Latitude 47 degrees. __eot__ Wait a second. He knows I know.
...You got my E-mail? __eot__ And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime. __eot__ Is that how Larry feels? __eot__ Uh. Not exactly.
Wanted to say goodbye to him... __eot__ Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms. __eot__ Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week. __eot__ What?!
They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers. __eot__ Jesus, Teddy. __eot__ I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo? __eot__ I met this girl. __eot__ What? Come on. Is it serious? __eot__ I don't know. __eot__ Did you tell Alice? __eot__ No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful. __eot__ A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances? __eot__ What d'you mean? __eot__ I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place. __eot__ What does that mean? __eot__ Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one. __eot__ I didn't plan this.
So -- how far are we from the campus? __eot__ Oh we're not going to the campus.
So how'd you like the house? __eot__ His Snapples were in alphabetical order. __eot__ Well, he micro-managed the company till it got too big...  'Guess he needs to micro-manage something.
Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa. But that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody. __eot__ She's a programmer? __eot__ Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her. __eot__ I've got a girlfriend, remember? __eot__ Right. That's rare around here. You know how nuns' re-married to Jesus? 'Posties are married to Outpost.
What're they building? __eot__ #21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in. __eot__ Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites. __eot__ You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested.
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale. __eot__ Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem? __eot__ There is no public offering. The guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in San Luis Obispo. 'Wrote this just to run their web site.
Maybe he'll get back to work. __eot__ Speaking of which... __eot__ Yeah, yeah.
Did you download Corey? In San Jose? __eot__ Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door. __eot__ You don't look anything like a three- year-old.
What is it? __eot__ Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall. __eot__ There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual. __eot__ Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --
That kid's the great white hope. __eot__ I could get it out of him. __eot__ You're not listening.
Who're these guys? __eot__ Where is he? __eot__ We're too late. Take a look.
Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now. __eot__ Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place. __eot__ We're all grateful for that. Really. Go out the way you came in?
You seem surprised to see me. __eot__ I thought you'd quit while you were ahead. __eot__ What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet? __eot__ What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it? __eot__ Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please? __eot__ You may. __eot__ Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills. __eot__ Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know? __eot__ I didn't, baby, you just told me. __eot__ It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable. __eot__ Behave!
Come in. __eot__ I'd rather talk about Number Two. __eot__ Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know.
May I wash you? __eot__ Groovy.
In Japan, men come first and women come second. __eot__ Or sometimes not at all. __eot__ Care for some saki? __eot__ Sak-i it to me!
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham? __eot__ Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.' __eot__ That's very clever. Do you know any other poems? __eot__ 'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!' __eot__ Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health. __eot__ To my health. __eot__ Kiss me.
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question? __eot__ Is it about my teeth? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon? __eot__ I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem. __eot__ I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.' __eot__ Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.
Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol. __eot__ Hey, how are you? __eot__ Hungry. __eot__ Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.
I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it. __eot__ If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man. __eot__ "Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either. __eot__ Smashing!
Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence.  You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone. __eot__ We know all that, Exposition. __eot__ I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world. __eot__ Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good. __eot__ I'm afraid not. Earlier this week, Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's planning a trap for you tonight at the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus here in swinging London.
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there. __eot__ Good luck, Austin. __eot__ Thank you. __eot__ Oh, and Austin... __eot__ Yes? __eot__ Be careful. __eot__ Thank you.  Let's go, baby!
Where am I? __eot__ You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years. __eot__ WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE? __eot__ The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process. __eot__ Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE! __eot__ You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence. __eot__ Russian Intelligence? Are you mad? __eot__ A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over. __eot__ Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades? __eot__ We won, Austin. __eot__ Groovy. Smashing! Good on ya!  Nice tie. Yea capitalism!
When do I begin? __eot__ Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington. __eot__ You mean Mrs. Kensington? __eot__ No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms.  Kensington is her daughter.
Vanessa's one of our top agents. __eot__ My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.
Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you. __eot__ Thank you, Exposition. __eot__ Oh, and Austin... __eot__ Yes? __eot__ Be careful. __eot__ Thanks.
Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms. __eot__ Thank you, Exposition. __eot__ Oh, and Austin... __eot__ Yes? __eot__ Be careful.
Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately. __eot__ Right away, Exposition. __eot__ Where is Vanessa, by the way?
She's working on another lead right now. __eot__ Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck. __eot__ Thank you, Basil. __eot__ Oh, and Austin... __eot__ Yes? __eot__ Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. __eot__ Oh, yes. Thank you. __eot__ There's one more thing, Austin. __eot__ Yes? __eot__ Be careful. __eot__ Thank you.
Hello, Exposition. __eot__ Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world. __eot__ Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war. __eot__ What's the other? __eot__ Excuse me? __eot__ What's the other thing you're scared of? __eot__ Carnies. __eot__ What? __eot__ Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage. __eot__ Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it. __eot__ Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system. __eot__ Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
My God, Austin, what have you done? __eot__ That's not your mother, that's a man!
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man. __eot__ Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother! __eot__ You must admit, she is rather mannish. No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick.
All right, Austin, I think you should go. __eot__ I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag. __eot__ I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin? __eot__ Yes, Basil? __eot__ Be careful. __eot__ Thanks.
Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair. __eot__ I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition. __eot__ Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you.
Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington! __eot__ Austin, I have something for you as well.
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you. __eot__ Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin-- __eot__ Yes Basil? __eot__ Be careful!
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger. __eot__ Hey, Mick! __eot__ Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin? __eot__ Well, you can't always get what you want. __eot__ "You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit. __eot__ Good on ya, man. __eot__ Groovy!
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to... __eot__ Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin. __eot__ Yes, I am programmed to answer any question. __eot__ Really? Let me ask you this. What is love? __eot__ That does not compute. __eot__ Why not? It's a question. __eot__ Love is... love is... love is...
What's wrong with your hand? __eot__ Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.
I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space. __eot__ Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr.  Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay? __eot__ No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
I've got you, Dr. Evil! __eot__ Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit. __eot__ No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man. __eot__ Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed. __eot__ That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility. __eot__ Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil. __eot__ Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care. __eot__ Man, you are one chilly square!
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967. __eot__ Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound. __eot__ My mother's told me all about you. __eot__ If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum? __eot__ My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much.
OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby. __eot__ Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport. __eot__ My jumbo jet? Smashing baby.
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense? __eot__ I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative... __eot__ That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag? __eot__ I beg your pardon? __eot__ I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working. __eot__ Excuse me? __eot__ My wedding tackle. __eot__ I'm sorry? __eot__ My meat and two veg. __eot__ Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest. __eot__ Have you ever made love to a Chigro? __eot__ A Chigro? __eot__ You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro. __eot__ We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive. __eot__ That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right?  Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews!
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest. __eot__ Sure. __eot__ Do I make you horny? __eot__ What? __eot__ Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest? __eot__ I hope this is part of the unfreezing process. __eot__ Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing. __eot__ I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
You've preserved my Jag! Smashing! __eot__ Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.
Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device. __eot__ No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry. __eot__ Why? What's wrong with my teeth?
Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine. __eot__ I'm sure. __eot__ I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling.
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses. __eot__ Here, use mine. __eot__ I'm going to use a cover name. It's important that it be a generic name so that we don't draw attention to ourselves.
I can't see a bloody thing. __eot__ Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.
Why did you leave so soon? __eot__ That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with? __eot__ Do you want to talk to him?
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear. __eot__ Why? __eot__ We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
A limousine has just pulled up. __eot__ Let me see.
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat. __eot__ How do you know? __eot__ I never forget a pussy... cat.
Let's go get him! __eot__ He's too well-protected right now. __eot__ We can't just sit here, Austin. __eot__ Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?' __eot__ I don't get it. __eot__ Well, you know... cows, and shagging. __eot__ Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped. __eot__ No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
I hate having my picture taken. __eot__ You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
Fancy a nibble? __eot__ I couldn't have another bite.
Watch out, you're on my hair! __eot__ Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous. __eot__ Go! Just go!
I haven't had fun like that since college. __eot__ I'm sorry. __eot__ Why? __eot__ I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell. __eot__ No, this is me in a nutshell.
You're smashed, Vanessa. __eot__ I am not. __eot__ Oh, yes you are. __eot__ I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
I can't. You're drunk. __eot__ It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know. __eot__ She was very groovy. She was so in love with your Dad. If there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me. But, unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed.
Really, Austin! __eot__ Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.
Austin, may I have a word with you? __eot__ Of course, luv. __eot__ Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry. __eot__ Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten. __eot__ I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection? __eot__ Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic. __eot__ No, did you use a condom? __eot__ Only sailors use condoms, man. __eot__ Not in the Nineties. __eot__ Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me. __eot__ Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man. __eot__ It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me. __eot__ You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely.
Hello, luv. __eot__ Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang. __eot__ Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming. __eot__ Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night. __eot__ Out and about, doing odds and sods. __eot__ I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum? __eot__ Do you think she's prettier than I? __eot__ Who? __eot__ You know who. __eot__ No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy. __eot__ I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.
Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges. __eot__ Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.
Thank God, Austin, we made it. __eot__ Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
Does that make you horny? __eot__ Not now, Austin.
First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts? __eot__ Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.
All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter. __eot__ No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge. __eot__ Smashing idea! Give it to me.
Not a good time to lose one's head. __eot__ Indeed. __eot__ That's not the way to get ahead in life. __eot__ Yes. __eot__ It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong. __eot__ Shut up. __eot__ Fair enough.
What do we do now? __eot__ We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor. __eot__ I'm not going anywhere. We're a team. __eot__ Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops. __eot__ I'll hurry back. __eot__ Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!-- __eot__ Austin, what's your point? __eot__ Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you. __eot__ Oh, behave!
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys. __eot__ Likewise. __eot__ I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I... __eot__ I believe you, Austin. Let's go. __eot__ Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail! __eot__ Are you crazy? __eot__ Don't worry!
Austin, I'm coming with you. __eot__ I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor. __eot__ I'll secure the perimeter.
I have something to tell you. __eot__ Lay it on me. __eot__ I love you, Austin. __eot__ That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa. __eot__ Kiss me. __eot__ Behave!
Danger Powers, personal effects. __eot__ Actually, my name's Austin Powers. __eot__ It says here, name Danger Powers. __eot__ Danger's my middle name. __eot__ OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump. __eot__ That's not mine. __eot__ One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers. __eot__ I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine. __eot__ One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers. __eot__ I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby. __eot__ One book: Swedish-Made Penis Enlarger Pumps and Me: This Sort of Thing Is My Bag, Baby, by Austin Powers.
Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges? __eot__ Sure.
Everything seems to be in order. __eot__ Hey, wait a minute--
Here, have a piece of gum. __eot__ Here, have a piece of gum.
Don't mind if I do. __eot__ Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece. __eot__ No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece. __eot__ I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert.
Noooooooooooooo! __eot__ Where did you learn to shoot?
Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle. __eot__ Is it one of ours? __eot__ No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir. __eot__ What are you saying, son? __eot__ It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir.
Oh my God, he's back. __eot__ In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices. __eot__ Shut up. __eot__ Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept? __eot__ What's its current position?
Commander, I have to log it... __eot__ That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left. __eot__ Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!
But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm... __eot__ And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!
We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash; __eot__ Silence!
Ahhhhhhhhh! __eot__ Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
We've got a lot of work to do. __eot__ Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned. __eot__ Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time. __eot__ Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain. __eot__ You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me.
Ow! You shot me! __eot__ Right. Okay. Moving on. __eot__ You shot me right in the arm!  Why did--
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son. __eot__ My son? __eot__ Yes.  Scott!
Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions? __eot__ Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers. __eot__ These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
Quite impressive. __eot__ Thank you, Herr Doctor. __eot__ I like to see girls of that caliber. By caliber, I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character... Forget it.
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal. __eot__ Dr. Evil? __eot__ Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph. __eot__ It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape. __eot__ Right.  Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads.
What is it now? __eot__ Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died. __eot__ I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have? __eot__ Sea bass. __eot__ Right. __eot__ They're mutated sea bass. __eot__ Really? Are they ill-tempered? __eot__ Please allow me to demonstrate.
That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville? __eot__ Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
No, the boy's right. I really am evil. __eot__ Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive. __eot__ We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you. __eot__ The details of my life are quite inconsequential. __eot__ That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
Hi. __eot__ Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours. __eot__ I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? I hate you!
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die? __eot__ Not me.
An evil vet? __eot__ No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something. __eot__ An evil petting zoo? __eot__ You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
Scott my boy, come here. How was your day? __eot__ Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'. __eot__ Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening? __eot__ Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax. __eot__ And that's how you want to live your life, is it? __eot__ Yeah. What?
Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers. __eot__ Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him? __eot__ In due time. __eot__ But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for? __eot__ I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death. __eot__ Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done. __eot__ One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank. __eot__ Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away! __eot__ No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan. __eot__ I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out. __eot__ No, Scott. You just don't get it, do you?
Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming? __eot__ I don't want to. __eot__ Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living? __eot__ Blow me. __eot__ What did you say? __eot__ Show me.
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group! __eot__ I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent. __eot__ I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab. __eot__ Scott, don't say that...
We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved. __eot__ Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually. __eot__ People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser."  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer." Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.
Umm, that also has already happened. __eot__ Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days. __eot__ All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year. __eot__ Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight? __eot__ Great. __eot__ How's Austin? __eot__ He's asleep. __eot__ You didn't... __eot__ Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
I'm proud of you. __eot__ Why? __eot__ Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.
Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre. __eot__ You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted. __eot__ What about his teeth? __eot__ You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter. __eot__ I just don't see it. __eot__ Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out. __eot__ Did you ever... __eot__ Of course not. I was married to your father. __eot__ Did you ever want to? __eot__ Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
You didn't answer my question, Mum. __eot__ I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone. __eot__ I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you. __eot__ I love you, Vanessa.
So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here? __eot__ Well, it's kind of weird. __eot__ We don't judge here. __eot__ OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business. __eot__ And how do you feel about that? __eot__ I don't wanna take over the family business.
What do you want to do, Scott? __eot__ I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
We don't label people here, Scott. __eot__ No, he's really evil. __eot__ Scott.
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me. __eot__ OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid. __eot__ Shame. I was recommended. By a friend. __eot__ Really? __eot__ Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June? __eot__ Normally, we'd be eager to oblige -- __eot__ Seriously? __eot__ Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods. __eot__ You don't say. How real does it feel? __eot__ As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason. __eot__ There are limits? __eot__ The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch. __eot__ No need. I'll call again.
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ... __eot__ ... bottle ... __eot__ Red ... __eot__ ... head ...
Knight ... __eot__ Black... __eot__ ... death ... __eot__ Love... __eot__ ... death ...
Flower ... __eot__ ... power ...
Nature ... __eot__ ... preserve... __eot__ Secret ... __eot__ ... love... __eot__ Hope... __eot__ ... love ... __eot__ Fear ... __eot__ ... love ... __eot__ Peter ...
How long have I been here? __eot__ Three days.
He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test. __eot__ So I'm still ...
Would that I could say the Same. __eot__ Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
I've come to apply for membership in Brolly -- __eot__ You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man.
I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it? __eot__ Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...
You __eot__ Have we met? __eot__ You mean you don't recall??
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised. __eot__ Promised? Who promised? __eot__ There, look!
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly! __eot__ Sir August...?  What now?
May I help you, madam ... __eot__ Mr. John Steed, please. __eot__ I'm afraid that's impossible. __eot__ Impossible?
You are female? __eot__ As you see. __eot__ Then you can't come in. __eot__ I have an appointment. __eot__ No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922. __eot__ Really -- what happened in 1922?
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ? __eot__ Eh? In here!
Quite a collection. __eot__ If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.
Your voice -- it's so familiar ... __eot__ We have met ...
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning. __eot__ This isn't a game. __eot__ Quite right, but we still make the rules. __eot__ Rules are made to be broken. __eot__ People, too. __eot__ Then who wins? __eot__ You and I. Together. But first you must confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be, Mrs. Peel? The answer is obvious ...
Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ... __eot__ Hmmm ... __eot__ Looks like rain, Steed...
My number two. Special assignments. She's -- __eot__ Let me guess -- 'Father'?
How curious ... __eot__ Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes. __eot__ Ropes?
Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's worried. __eot__ He tried to warn us ...
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes? __eot__ Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world. __eot__ After the cold war ...
I resign. __eot__ You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign. __eot__ Watch me.
What are you trying to do to me? __eot__ We want to help...! __eot__ I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that. __eot__ The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ... __eot__ To you ... ?
Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved. __eot__ The Institute ... the funding ... __eot__ A cover ... for us.  I'm sorry...
Who? __eot__ Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going? __eot__ To find out who killed my husband. __eot__ The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment. __eot__ So am I.
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ... __eot__ Next assignment?
Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ... __eot__ Thank you, Steed.
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma. __eot__ Thanks, Valentine ...
You. __eot__ Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the Prospero Project ...
A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ... __eot__ Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ... __eot__ An unholy trinity ... __eot__ You killed my husband. __eot__ For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ... __eot__ Too many cooks -- __eot__ Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ... __eot__ But I found you. All the clues led me here ... __eot__ Of course. I planned that, too. __eot__ But -- why? __eot__ You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ... __eot__ 'Our revels now are ended.' __eot__ Oh, no, Emma. They've only just begun ...
Think of this as your second wedding feast ... __eot__ I'm already married ... __eot__ Come, come, you're a widow -- a most attractive widow. Now I think of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here.
You know, I believe she's actually jealous. __eot__ Valentine, listen to me ... __eot__ Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring. __eot__ Ring?
That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ... __eot__ You're mad. __eot__ Entirely. On the other hand  Mad people get things done. Let me show you --
Such as? __eot__ Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air. __eot__ The result would be ... __eot__ Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples... __eot__ Then what's stopping you? __eot__ One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete. __eot__ How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter. __eot__ Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel. __eot__ What are my choices? __eot__ Choices? __eot__ I'll never marry you.
Doctor Peel, I presume? __eot__ And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
I was about to throw in the towel. __eot__ I had a spot of bother at the door. __eot__ I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since -- __eot__ 1922. Why the kippers? __eot__ Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think? __eot__ So what was all this -- some sort of test? __eot__ Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor. __eot__ Whereas you are. __eot__ Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules. __eot__ Rules are made to be broken. __eot__ Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing. __eot__ And just what is the game? __eot__ I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel? __eot__ Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel. __eot__ Much better. __eot__ And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you? __eot__ I didn't. Mother did. __eot__ Mother?
... Showers followed by sunny periods. __eot__ We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker. __eot__ A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
My father always wanted a boy. __eot__ Really?  I fail to see the connection. __eot__ I had a feeling you would. Touche!
Do you? __eot__ Yes indeed. I need protection.
I thought we were on our way. __eot__ Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod. __eot__ Or half cocked.
Steed, we really must be -- __eot__ Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?
You can but I wish you wouldn't ... __eot__ Thank you, Trubshaw ...
That place is so absurd, so out of date ... __eot__ Do you really think so?
You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk? __eot__ Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
But why? What's the point? __eot__ A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor. __eot__ And I suppose you're the knight. __eot__ The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen. __eot__ That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know.
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first? __eot__ As per mother's instructions. __eot__ Do we always follow Mother's instructions? __eot__ For a man in my position -- __eot__ Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work? __eot__ They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself. __eot__ I have no choice. Why should you risk your life? __eot__ After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea? __eot__ No thanks. __eot__ I meant me.
According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ... __eot__ An eccentric recluse?
Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie. __eot__ June, July ... August? __eot__ The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined. __eot__ Any other vices? __eot__ All of a piece, really. A fanatical weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY.  British Royal Organisation For Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British weather has been tampered with by ... aliens.
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How? __eot__ Small talk.  Try the weather.
Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel? __eot__ You should be dead.  How do you feel? __eot__ Strange. __eot__ You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank. __eot__ I wasn't about to. __eot__ I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed. __eot__ I might say the same.
Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you. __eot__ Why should they think that? __eot__ You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead. __eot__ Frankly that's how I remember it. __eot__ But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style. __eot__ Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel. __eot__ That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised. __eot__ Did he say who? __eot__ No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this.
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...? __eot__ Did you say formal? I must dress.
I must say, you look more your old self -- __eot__ You mean my other self ... __eot__ Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion? __eot__ I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry. __eot__ How on earth can you tell?
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ... __eot__ Very good, Steed ...
What on earth? __eot__ Any ideas? __eot__ Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ... __eot__ Is that written in his shoe? __eot__ Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ... __eot__ She had this in her mouth. There, there...
For you, Mrs. Peel. __eot__ Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
But __eot__ Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
Not quite. This is my field. __eot__ Is there anything that isn't? __eot__ The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'... __eot__ Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ? __eot__ Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ... __eot__ But if someone miniaturized the process... __eot__ That's what we were working on. __eot__ Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
Three agents killed by bad weather... __eot__ ... And by you, Mrs. Peel ... __eot__ Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ... __eot__ ... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin? __eot__ Not that I know of.  Explanation? __eot__ According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.
Is that what you think? __eot__ Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
Do you always drive this fast? __eot__ Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing? __eot__ Barely. __eot__ You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you?
This must be the last straw. __eot__ Here's the one that broke the camel's back. __eot__ Someone didn't want us to get to the party. __eot__ I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
Steed ... ! __eot__ Mrs. Peel ... ?
Where am I? __eot__ The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ... __eot__ Was I? __eot__ I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ... __eot__ It was Peter -- I saw him ...
You followed me. __eot__ Orders. __eot__ To kill me? __eot__ Nothing personal.
I could save you the trouble. __eot__ No trouble. __eot__ Because you always obey orders ... __eot__ Always.  Except ...
Yes ... ? __eot__ ... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.
And do you trust me? __eot__ I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ... __eot__ It wasn't me; you have my word.
Mmm ... what are you doing? __eot__ Keeping a stiff upper lip? __eot__ Is that all?
But you did suspect me. __eot__ Not for a moment. __eot__ You're playing games. __eot__ Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel? __eot__ I thought you played by the rules. __eot__ I thought you didn't. __eot__ I'm playing to win. __eot__ Winning isn't everything. __eot__ Please don't tell me it's how you play the game. __eot__ After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
No, after you. __eot__ You don't trust me? __eot__ As far as you trust me.
I told Mother I took care of you. __eot__ You lied. __eot__ I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...
Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who? __eot__ No idea who. No idea why ... __eot__ Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ... __eot__ ... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children. __eot__ Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies? __eot__ Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful. __eot__ I'm a wanted woman, I know ...
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones. __eot__ Why's he called 'Invisible'? __eot__ You'll find out.
Aren't you coming? __eot__ I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ... __eot__ Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now -- __eot__ You didn't tell her?
There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend. __eot__ Have we been invited?
What's that you're wearing? __eot__ It's called Black Leather. __eot__ Intoxicating. Here, have one of these.
What is it? __eot__ Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's. __eot__ When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit. __eot__ You first. __eot__ Shall we?
Trubshaw again? What now? __eot__ Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel. __eot__ 'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers? __eot__ Have a look at this.
I'll be back ... __eot__ Where are you going? __eot__ Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ... __eot__ You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect. __eot__ No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well. __eot__ But -- __eot__ Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder. __eot__ If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --
Mrs. Peel? __eot__ What kept you? __eot__ The plot.  Hello, we must be going ...
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -' __eot__ '... in a beautiful pea green boat...' __eot__ A fine night, Mrs. Peel ... __eot__ Still a bit chilly ... __eot__ English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ... __eot__ Have you any place in mind? __eot__ As a matter of fact I have ...
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed. __eot__ It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel. __eot__ Our little paradise -- just made for two? __eot__ Not quite.
Our chaperon. __eot__ Pity your mother came, too ...
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby? __eot__ Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died. __eot__ I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect. __eot__ You're saying I have no choice.
Where's Mother? __eot__ Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
You don't believe him? __eot__ It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here.
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete. __eot__ Decontamination -- ? __eot__ And you've a new wardrobe. He does want you to look attractive.  He tells me you're very beautiful.
Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal. __eot__ I see. __eot__ Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel. __eot__ Peter's brother?  But -- __eot__ Half-brother to be precise.
Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ... __eot__ I know all this. __eot__ Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance? __eot__ Surveillance? By whom? __eot__ Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling. __eot__ Who's now vanished. __eot__ Makes two of us. __eot__ Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.
I was getting to it. __eot__ Getting to what? __eot__ The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative -- __eot__ I fail to see --
Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ... __eot__ Well, I can't possibly go like this.
'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation... __eot__ ... and now?
Privately owned by ... __eot__ Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather. __eot__ Very good, Mrs. Peel ... __eot__ I shall need a small plane. __eot__ You're not venturing alone, surely. __eot__ I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ... __eot__ Global warming? __eot__ Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?
We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel. __eot__ So you say ...
Oh, hello ... __eot__ We want Mrs. Peel. __eot__ Dead, I'm afraid.
Steed __eot__ How did you guess? __eot__ You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ... __eot__ It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...' __eot__ Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
Mother. I thought you were burglars. __eot__ Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
Weather's turning nasty. __eot__ You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely. __eot__ Oh yes I did. I want you to meet somebody.  I expect you'll like her.
Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise. __eot__ Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --
Think she really killed those agents? __eot__ She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill. __eot__ Amnesia? __eot__ Possibly. Split personality ... __eot__ Insane ... ? __eot__ Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out. __eot__ Why? __eot__ She may try to kill you.
Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open. __eot__ How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination. __eot__ Anyone particular in mind? __eot__ You.
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ... __eot__ Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb. __eot__ Impossible.
This man -- did you see him? __eot__ No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.
You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband? __eot__ Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...
Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately -- __eot__ Guilty until proven innocent? __eot__ Mother and Father know best.
I was hoping you could tell me. __eot__ You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I. __eot__ I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole. __eot__ Where? __eot__ In your operation. __eot__ I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
Are you alright, young man? __eot__ I think so, thank you so much ...
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy. __eot__ I feel sure of it. __eot__ I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you? __eot__ She was ...
You with Mother or Father? __eot__ Both, actually. __eot__ Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry. __eot__ You don't say.  Like looking for a needle in a ...
Wonderland Weather Ltd. __eot__ This way ...
Mrs. Peel -- ? __eot__ Ask not for whom the telephone rings ... __eot__ No, please! I beg you ... __eot__ Walk over to the window ... __eot__ Let it be rain, please let it be -- __eot__ Stay by the window. By the window.
John Steed. __eot__ Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face. __eot__ The last one you'll ever see. __eot__ Perish the thought.
You're better than I expected. __eot__ I was at Harrow ... __eot__ But did they teach you this?
Bang-bang ... you're dead. __eot__ You wish.
One shot -- for emergencies. __eot__ That's not playing by the rules. __eot__ Rules are made to be broken. __eot__ If you say so. __eot__ I do.
You said ... one shot. __eot__ Did I? My mistake.
Aren't you forgetting about something? __eot__ You are, and it's behind you. __eot__ Come, come. You don't really expect me to fall for --
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel? __eot__ Ugh ...
What's happening? __eot__ Debbie's marrying Rick. __eot__ ...Really?
Does Cole know about this? __eot__ Really -- you went with him for two years.
I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex. __eot__ Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
Look at that guy. What a hunk. __eot__ Check out the other guy's buns.
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited. __eot__ Bobbie, what are you talking about? __eot__ O'Neill just tole me. It's sooo great... I don't believe it.
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow. __eot__ He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either. __eot__ No. As far as they're concerned the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I don't care... it's my decision.
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party? __eot__ They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies. __eot__ What do you mean? __eot__ I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car. __eot__ You're kidding. __eot__ Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em.
That's what we're going to find out... __eot__ I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers. __eot__ Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion? __eot__ Rick's got an important announcement to make. __eot__ Yeah. What is it?
What? __eot__ You're kidding.
Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads. __eot__ Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women. __eot__ Chulo, one thing at a time. __eot__ Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it.
I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes. __eot__ Women!
Hey, you guys, what's going on? __eot__ We're going for a little liquid refreshment. __eot__ Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you?
I've decided not to run for President. __eot__ Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
Man, you're losing your audience. __eot__ Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro. __eot__ Hey, man, congratulations!
You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together? __eot__ Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks. __eot__ I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero. __eot__ What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
All right! __eot__ When do the girls get to the party?
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment. __eot__ I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
And... __eot__ Bond... James Bond.
Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding? __eot__ I want Debbie. __eot__ Cole... __eot__ You dump her and I'll give you cash. __eot__ What's Debbie's blue book value right now? __eot__ Five thousand dollars. __eot__ No.
Seventy-five hundred. __eot__ Not interested. __eot__ Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart... __eot__ I'm marrying Debbie. __eot__ Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools... __eot__ What is this person's story here?
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away. __eot__ He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would. __eot__ Thank you. We'll all keep that in mind. 'Bye now.
Rick, I want to talk to you. __eot__ Ah, Cole.  I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.
I don't want any trouble. __eot__ Oh, come on, just a little. __eot__ I'm ready to make you another deal. __eot__ Ooh, be still, my heart. __eot__ See that down there? That's my most prized possession. My new Porsche.
Great car. __eot__ The best. __eot__ I love that car. __eot__ I'm very happy for you two.
I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap. __eot__ The car for Debbie? __eot__ I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie. __eot__ Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
Low mileage... Handles like a dream. __eot__ So does Debbie.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone! __eot__ Maybe it had something to do. __eot__ Shit!
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be. __eot__ Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy? __eot__ You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
Cole, what the hell are you doing? __eot__ She's mine!
He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters. __eot__ Fan out and look for them.
Hello? __eot__ Mr. Thomerson. __eot__ Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is? __eot__ Yes I did. __eot__ Fine. How's everything going? __eot__ Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...
Hi, everybody. Am I late? __eot__ Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
So, Cole, you been practicing your game? __eot__ Sure have...
Nice shot. __eot__ Thank you, sir. __eot__ I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick. __eot__ Yes, sir, I am. __eot__ Cole, I don't want you to give up on her. __eot__ I've tried to change her mind. __eot__ It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there. __eot__ But how can I do that? __eot__ If it were me, I'd reason with him first. Then, if that failed...  ...I'd take more persuasive action.
Thanks for the advise, sir. __eot__ Keep me informed.
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me? __eot__ What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise. __eot__ Well, tell the asshole to shut up. __eot__ Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir. __eot__ Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened? __eot__ The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down... __eot__ Take hold of yourself. What room are they in? __eot__ 1002. __eot__ All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes. __eot__ Yes, sir.
Cole? __eot__ Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
Cole, we've got to talk. __eot__ Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh? __eot__ No, Cole, I... __eot__ It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas. __eot__ Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you... __eot__ You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough... __eot__ Cole, I'm marrying Rick. __eot__ You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me? __eot__ I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry, Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.  No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy. __eot__ Cole, I'm sorry, I... __eot__ That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me. __eot__ I'm going now, Cole. __eot__ I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy.
God, you're a slob. __eot__ But a fabulous cook. __eot__ What are we having? __eot__ It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished. __eot__ I think your dinner's burning.
Don't worry... it's supposed to do this. __eot__ Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun. __eot__ Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me. __eot__ You're going to have a bachelor party? __eot__ Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think? __eot__ It looks awful. __eot__ Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however. __eot__ Are you going to have women at your party? __eot__ No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home. __eot__ I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers. __eot__ Oh, those. Why do you ask? __eot__ Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
Huh? Wha... __eot__ I can't sleep. __eot__ Oh... I got something for that.
Stop fooling around... I need to talk. __eot__ What's the matter? __eot__ I don't know... I just feel scared. __eot__ About what? __eot__ The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party... __eot__ I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right. __eot__ Before or After I have my nervous breakfown? __eot__ C'mere.
That feels so great. __eot__ Good... __eot__ Um... that's very relaxing. __eot__ Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness. __eot__ You better not have too much joy. __eot__ Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're... __eot__ Gonna get married...
This is it, lady. Last stop. __eot__ Can't I just go with you guys? __eot__ Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.
Remember, you promised... no screwing around. __eot__ Did I promise that? I don't remember that... __eot__ You're really pissing me off.
Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave. __eot__ Your mother's not dead. __eot__ Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her.
Have a good time. Don't make it too late. __eot__ Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap. __eot__ I love you.
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around. __eot__ How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker. __eot__ Why don't you get undressed.
I can't trust you! __eot__ C'mon, I knew it was you. __eot__ Rick, you're lying!
Let go of me! __eot__ Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly. __eot__ The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life. __eot__ I don't want that. I want to be with you. __eot__ And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment. __eot__ I am committed. I love you.
I don't believe you. __eot__ You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand? __eot__ Yes... __eot__ Great. Now, what do you want to do about it? __eot__ Let's get naked. __eot__ You're on.
Are you okay? __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout? __eot__ You're so romantic...
If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party. __eot__ Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick. __eot__ Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble? __eot__ Ilene, Rick promised... __eot__ Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs.
Are you sure this is a good idea? __eot__ Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party. __eot__ That doesn't mean it was Rick's party. __eot__ Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
Let's go. __eot__ Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it! __eot__ Ilene, are you crazy? __eot__ I know what I'm doing... Go!
I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year. __eot__ Great, Mom.
Why is Cole here? __eot__ You know your father enjoys his company.
A strange wang right in my palm. __eot__ Ilene, we don't really know that.
What kind of job? I'm a housewife. __eot__ Quiet, Mother.
I hope Ilene's all right. __eot__ I hope those guys are all right.
Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant. __eot__ My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying? __eot__ A real turd. __eot__ Well... hope she'll be very happy.
Great bathing suit. __eot__ I think I screwed that one once.
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it. __eot__ Any time, Al.
So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop. __eot__ Let's see your bread.
Park View Hotel, Room 1002. __eot__ They'll be up there in a half hour. __eot__ Okay. Nice to meet you both.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women? __eot__ What are you talking about, asshole? __eot__ Your whores never showed up. __eot__ They left an hour ago, pink nuts. __eot__ Screw you!
That's it, prick lips. __eot__ What are you... __eot__ I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got? __eot__ Why? __eot__ Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash.
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere. __eot__ Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
Give him the works. __eot__ That's more like it.
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys. __eot__ Gary, you're quite an animal. __eot__ Screw you...
Let's go. __eot__ Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement? __eot__ All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married? __eot__ Because I love her. What can I tell you?
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will. __eot__ Let's have a toast.
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner. __eot__ What's going on?
It's true. __eot__ This place should have been wall to wall tits by now. __eot__ Guy paints a beautiful picture. __eot__ I'm going to see what the hell happened. __eot__ Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you. __eot__ Screw that.
Hookers beat you up? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ I didn't know you were into that.
Gary, how we doing, big stallion? __eot__ Rick, I really think I'm in love. __eot__ This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on.
What can I be doing for you? __eot__ You're a pimp? __eot__ I'm telling you I am, Joe. __eot__ I want women. __eot__ That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want. __eot__ I'll take some. __eot__ Big problem now. Soon they go to customers. __eot__ I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel. __eot__ You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes. __eot__ Sold. 45 minutes. No problem. __eot__ Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you. __eot__ Milt?
So, Larry, how have you been? __eot__ Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody.
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch. __eot__ Larry, you and your wife got problems? __eot__ I don't want to talk about it. I love you guys. I love my friends.
Is that all the coke in the place? __eot__ That's it. __eot__ Good.
You want to share it? __eot__ Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck. __eot__ Right.
My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit. __eot__ Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while. __eot__ She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man? __eot__ What do you mean, it changes?
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here. __eot__ C'mon, Larry. Be good for you. __eot__ I just want to be alone. __eot__ All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after "Falcon Crest."
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean. __eot__ No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
You okay? __eot__ Yeah, I guess so. __eot__ Really? __eot__ Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
What the hell are you doing? __eot__ I'm trying to slash my wrists. __eot__ You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor? __eot__ I couldn't find any razor blades. __eot__ Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up. __eot__ Ha, ha, ha. __eot__ No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party.
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend. __eot__ It's Bullwinkle.
It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs... __eot__ It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
Are any of those right? __eot__ This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone? __eot__ Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002.
It's on the tenth floor. __eot__ What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys. __eot__ I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
You're all under arrest. Open up! __eot__ Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!
Oops! __eot__ All right, who serves?
Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it. __eot__ Can't I just maim it a little?
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience. __eot__ Rick, I want to cut through the b.s. __eot__ I'd love that. __eot__ Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes. __eot__ Mr. Thomerson, I... __eot__ Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions... __eot__ Feel free. __eot__ First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
Welcome, welcome, one and all. __eot__ Rick! __eot__ Oh, no!
The end. __eot__ No sob story is going to change my mind.
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable... __eot__ Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now. __eot__ No. Let's at least finish the set.
Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade? __eot__ In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck. __eot__ You can tell a man by his friends.
Ed... you're kinky! __eot__ The phone made me do it! __eot__ You've been having strange sex...! __eot__ No, Brett, I... __eot__ It's all right...  So have I.
How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...? __eot__ Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner. __eot__ Mrs.? __eot__ I'm separated. __eot__ Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture.
I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons? __eot__ Of course.
Where'd she go? __eot__ She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
Where the hell is he? __eot__ Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
What's the matter? __eot__ Nothing... Let's get crazy!
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"... __eot__ Olivier's in that, right? __eot__ Then it's on to the real thing.
Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican. __eot__ This isn't right.
Don't you love it when old friends stop by? __eot__ Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody. __eot__ I'm not really hungry. __eot__ C'mon. I insist.
What the hell is that? __eot__ My gift to you. __eot__ Under the table! __eot__ The best table in the house.
I think you'll enjoy this table. __eot__ So long, Father.
I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now? __eot__ I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
Rick, I'm concerned. __eot__ About what? __eot__ This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet. __eot__ Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens. __eot__ I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please. __eot__ Oooooo. __eot__ Right in there, pal. __eot__ If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics. __eot__ That's the old Rick!
How'd it go? __eot__ Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister. __eot__ I'm proud of you, lad.
Who was that? __eot__ I don't know. __eot__ What's this? __eot__ Got me.
How 'bout this? __eot__ Still drawing a blank.
He look familiar? __eot__ Very. __eot__ C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business.
Now, don't get into any trouble. __eot__ Take care.
Hey, you guys... __eot__ Who's your friend?
How about this, a Trojan donkey. __eot__ And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
What are you going to do about it? __eot__ What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing. __eot__ I'll stop him... You stall him.
Reach out and snort someone. __eot__ I'm saved. Let's party!
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest. __eot__ Who? __eot__ Debbie. __eot__ My Debbie? __eot__ What's with her costume?
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom. __eot__ You got it.
You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky. __eot__ Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me. __eot__ True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already? __eot__ You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that. __eot__ Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay?
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood. __eot__ Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break. __eot__ Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next. __eot__ Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect? __eot__ Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts. __eot__ Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party. __eot__ Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
You're late again, Rick. __eot__ I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse. __eot__ There can be no excuse for tardiness. __eot__ You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book. __eot__ Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is. __eot__ Right... Think it over.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside? __eot__ I don't know. __eot__ What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out. __eot__ Maybe I did... I don't remember. __eot__ I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.
Can you believe how perfect it fits? __eot__ Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
Oh these moments do try me... __eot__ Be gentle.
Wash it to the windows? __eot__ No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on. __eot__ It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it. __eot__ Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling.
That's Franny. She likes firemen. __eot__ Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life? __eot__ No.  I need a drink.
You know Knowlton pretty well? __eot__ Yeah... __eot__ Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?
Biggest in two battalions. __eot__ We're gonna be okay, man...
Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side. __eot__ It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one. __eot__ -- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here. __eot__ Let me take the lead, Stephen... __eot__ Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!
Aw man, Stephen, listen to me... __eot__ -- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman. __eot__ They were killing firemen, man. When Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's files... They were my friends, I had to do it. I had to do it for the department.
-- Knock it off! __eot__ -- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do? __eot__ There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.
You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing! __eot__ Stevie... I...
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay. __eot__ My Lt. might have something to say about that. __eot__ Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family. __eot__ John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see...
Is he... __eot__ He's alive.
Did you do it for Tim? __eot__ That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
You gotta let me finish -- __eot__ Just come down, John. Just -- __eot__ -- Shut up! Your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you've shit on his department!
-- He killed people -- __eot__ -- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? -- __eot__ -- Stephen, this is bullshit -- __eot__ -- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --
It doesn't go like that. __eot__ Who asked you? __eot__ If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE.
Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it? __eot__ I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me. __eot__ So you're going to fight fires now, huh?
Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother. __eot__ Not likely. __eot__ Well, see you're wrong already. Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we decided in the interest of brotherly love, that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the other side of town. So starting tomorrow, your assigned to company 17. My company.  One case of scotch, you're getting cheap in your old age, Brian...
I like what you've done with the place. __eot__ It's comin' along... want a beer?
Been ripping off fire stations? __eot__ It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
My God, an actual operating 8-track. __eot__ What, you've never seen one before? __eot__ In the Field Museum once. __eot__ It works. __eot__ It worked when you were in sixth grade.
People actually used to pay you for this? __eot__ Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors. __eot__ Sheep don't count. __eot__ Yeah? What about Laura -- __eot__ That was never proved.
Why'd you come here, Brian? __eot__ I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games? __eot__ What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man. __eot__ Hey! You don't know me -- __eot__ I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer? __eot__ So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood? __eot__ Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.
There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer. __eot__ Thanks for the speakers.
Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt... __eot__ Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like. __eot__ I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know. __eot__ I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
Ya love it, probie? __eot__ I'm in heaven, Lt. __eot__ Hook us up to a stand-pipe.
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me. __eot__ -- C'mon, Stephen. __eot__ -- You split the team, man. And what was that crap with the standpipe? You'd think you and a hose were never introduced before.
Goddamn it Stephen! __eot__ -- I told you to stay next to me! __eot__ -- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did! __eot__ What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose... __eot__ -- Never mind.
Thanks. __eot__ Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
Hey. __eot__ Hey.
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what? __eot__ Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too. __eot__ C'mon, let's crawl home.
Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind... __eot__ This? __eot__ Yeah... too bright...
Roll the hose. __eot__ What, are you kidding? By myself?
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time. __eot__ You got a problem with drilling, probie? __eot__ No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me. __eot__ Roll the hose.
Ready? __eot__ Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team... __eot__ Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us.
You okay? __eot__ I waited... I would have fucking waited... __eot__ That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way. __eot__ Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance? __eot__ You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today?  What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game. __eot__ Thanks for the insight. __eot__ Brian, look -- __eot__ Just leave me alone, okay?
...Not now, Brian. __eot__ Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen? __eot__ I had that fire. He didn't listen! __eot__ He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him. __eot__ Fuck you.
Hey, what are you doing here? __eot__ Just... Just wanted to say hello... __eot__ So hello.
Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes. __eot__ You're selling dad's boat? __eot__ Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them... __eot__ I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do. __eot__ Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay. __eot__ Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other -- __eot__ -- Okay, so you don't like me. You don't like everything I've done. What, because I wasn't such a genius the way I raised you? Jesus Christ, dad was gone, what was I supposed to do? You tell me, what the fuck was I supposed to do?!
It's okay, Stephen, I -- __eot__ -- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...
I saw it. __eot__ Saw what? __eot__ When dad died, I saw another fire... __eot__ Everybody did. __eot__ I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die. __eot__ ...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there? __eot__ I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on... __eot__ Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian. __eot__ Sometimes right when you're looking at them.
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you? __eot__ I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's -- __eot__ -- What are you doing here? __eot__ I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people! __eot__ I know. __eot__ How do you know? __eot__ I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me. __eot__ -- What were they doing there? __eot__ They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
Anything else? __eot__ What are we going to do about this? __eot__ I'll handle it. __eot__ We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen. __eot__ I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility. I'll handle it. Me.
You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen? __eot__ Shut up!
You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong? __eot__ "You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --" __eot__ Oh shut up, huh?  I think I broke my goddamn arm...
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em... __eot__ I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
Brian. __eot__ Jennifer. __eot__ You're back. __eot__ You look great. __eot__ Thanks for calling. __eot__ Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today. __eot__ Huh. __eot__ So... I see you're still in the neighborhood. __eot__ Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now. __eot__ Yeah? What have you been up to? __eot__ I work for city hall. __eot__ Really? No kidding. __eot__ What, you think I just dried up and blew away when you left? The world does turn once in awhile Brian, even without your permission.
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends. __eot__ I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
With grenadine, right? __eot__ When I was twenty. __eot__ Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?
Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here. __eot__ Carrying Swayzak's notebook? __eot__ Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor. __eot__ Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy? __eot__ Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side -- __eot__ -- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt. __eot__ Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard. __eot__ Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters. __eot__ I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II.
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that. __eot__ C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth. __eot__ Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once. __eot__ So now you suddenly care about my future? __eot__ Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us. __eot__ Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it. __eot__ ...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian. __eot__ Yeah...
Arson. __eot__ Straightest answer your department's given me all week.
Hey. __eot__ How's it going? __eot__ Boss and I are up to about three words an hour. __eot__ Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come. __eot__ I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here.
I could use a date. __eot__ Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
Hi. __eot__ Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what? __eot__ If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes... __eot__ Sorry.  Are you dating anyone? __eot__ You think that's really any of your business? __eot__ Well, you did invite me here. __eot__ Marty did.  But I wanted you to come to.
Okay. __eot__ Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he? __eot__ No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one. __eot__ Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not. __eot__ Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked. __eot__ But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson. __eot__ In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.
Thanks for the invite. __eot__ Got anything to drink in there? __eot__ Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies.
This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think? __eot__ Homey. __eot__ See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know? __eot__ Do you miss it?  You seem like you do. __eot__ When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman. __eot__ Then why did you quit? __eot__ I wanted to be a good one.
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose. __eot__ Uh huh.
Brian. What's wrong? __eot__ You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news. __eot__ I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators -- __eot__ -- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers -- __eot__ Will you please keep your voice down, there's people -- __eot__ -- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points. __eot__ I was doing my job. __eot__ Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"? __eot__ Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother -- __eot__ Leave Stephen out of this -- __eot__ Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak -- __eot__ -- I work for the city. __eot__ You knew what we were asking you to do. Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now. The fit isn't right.
Hi. __eot__ Hi. __eot__ We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day -- __eot__ Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden. __eot__ I don't know anything about it. __eot__ You could check. It'd be in his files. __eot__ Do you know what you're asking me to do? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away? __eot__ Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
What is -- __eot__ Just take it.
I'm sorry. __eot__ That's a dumb thing to say. __eot__ You're right.
I think your boss is going to need some spin control. __eot__ I quit two days ago, Brian. __eot__ What'll you do? __eot__ I don't have the slightest idea... __eot__ I'll see ya around, huh? __eot__ It's a small town.
Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh? __eot__ Hey, do I know you?
I'm close... but I can't get who it is... __eot__ So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair? __eot__ Who's doing this? __eot__ Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin? __eot__ Then who -- __eot__ -- No no, your turn. Tell me a story. __eot__ I don't have a story. __eot__ Sure you do.
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there? __eot__ What? __eot__ You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard -- __eot__ I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal. __eot__ Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard! __eot__ -- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything... __eot__ Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen. __eot__ The outlets. __eot__ That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian. __eot__ Trychticholorate. __eot__ Good. -- So our two heroes, Adcox and McCaffrey, they go back inside. Only there's another fire in there nobody sees. And it took your dad, didn't it Brian? Did you see him burn?
Who the fuck is doing this? __eot__ After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...
Oh Jesus Christ... __eot__ Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing. __eot__ You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did? __eot__ I want another shot, Sir. __eot__ Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back? __eot__ If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top -- __eot__ -- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot. __eot__ I need another one, sir. __eot__ Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year. __eot__ No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir. __eot__ Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you. __eot__ See you Monday. Sir.
Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant. __eot__ Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
Are you still here? __eot__ Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere. __eot__ Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way. __eot__ I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city. __eot__ Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the hammer.  You think you're the first?
Where are you going? __eot__ Pest control.
-- Shhh. __eot__ What are you listening to?
So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry...  Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance.  Find me some glass. __eot__ Glass? __eot__ Do we have a language barrier here? Glass.
Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air... __eot__ -- Another backdraft.
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire. __eot__ No it couldn't.
Uh, I don't think that's in my contract... __eot__ I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...
Read. __eot__ "Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --" __eot__ -- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties. __eot__ "During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium". __eot__ Ever burned magnesium? It's so hot it takes water molecules and BAMM!
Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue. __eot__ Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.
Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes. __eot__ And the putty around the door? __eot__ Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier __eot__ But the right guess on this is arson. __eot__ I don't guess. __eot__ Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case. __eot__ I don't work for them, either.
That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire! __eot__ What? __eot__ I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. __eot__ But he killed these guys. __eot__ But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason. __eot__ What reason? __eot__ Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out. __eot__ That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience? __eot__ No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point. __eot__ Are you going public with this? __eot__ No. Do that and I guarantee you'll scare him off. I don't want him running away.
What the hell are you doing here? __eot__ I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.
In a word, Brian, what is this job all about? __eot__ Fire.
Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb. __eot__ Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants... __eot__ And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either. __eot__ Nice bunch of guys. __eot__ Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight. __eot__ Yeah? Airtight?
I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along. __eot__ Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box. __eot__ Then who wrote the report? __eot__ It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now... __eot__ How ya feeling?
Did you pull me out? __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ Did I say thanks? __eot__ No. __eot__ Just wondering. __eot__ I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless...
So what do you want me to do? __eot__ I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
Your brother was a good man. __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows. __eot__ Like it never happened...
Brian? __eot__ Hi, Helen. Man, you look great. __eot__ You look like... Brian.
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town? __eot__ Four months. __eot__ Four months? __eot__ I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.
That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant. __eot__ Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid. __eot__ Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle? __eot__ Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway? __eot__ Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
Oh, man, I'm sorry. __eot__ You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
Yeah. Big fan. __eot__ And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian. __eot__ Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman. __eot__ No need to be modest, Brian. __eot__ No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin. __eot__ -- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command. __eot__ Every little boy's fantasy. __eot__ Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job. __eot__ I have a job. __eot__ This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan. __eot__ Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young. __eot__ Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.
Mr. McCaffrey... __eot__ Nice boat. __eot__ It isn't mine.  Let's get a picture.
Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy? __eot__ Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
Completely out of control. __eot__ What the hell are we waiting for?
Aren't you even curious? __eot__ Engine 115, right? __eot__ How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed. __eot__ Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments. __eot__ You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115? __eot__ Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station. __eot__ Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your way into a station, why not 17 with me and your brother?
Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening. __eot__ Backdraft.
Do you have to do that? __eot__ Could you believe that fire? Man! First day! There I was, Adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it here -- No surround and drown for this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn Stephen's amazing. You see how he took that fire by the balls? I'm gonna be that good some day, you watch.
Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it". __eot__ Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
What? __eot__ "Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
So, you surviving without me? __eot__ There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed. __eot__ Swayzak's not my boss.
Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey.  Hey! You break anything with that you buy it!  Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's a fire department uniform. __eot__ It's in my blood, Willy.
Really. Well, let's have a look at what else was "in your blood". I always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... "Assistant Director, Sales, Aspen Snowmobile Tours..." __eot__ Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need. __eot__ Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it? __eot__ Management were pin heads. __eot__ "Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"? __eot__ Coffee sucked. __eot__ And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step. __eot__ I was ahead of my time. __eot__ You know, I've got a perfect little spot here for "Brian McCaffrey, Fireman"...
Who's going to die? __eot__ Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right. __eot__ Well, let's have a look.
Your brother's right. If you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned. __eot__ And DIE!
Fireman shit? __eot__ Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn? __eot__ Firehouse. __eot__ Cute.
Dad! __eot__ You've come along a dozen times, Stephen, give your brother a chance. We'll be back in a few minutes.  How 'bout it, sport?
I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it. __eot__ Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.
Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you. __eot__ I'm busy. __eot__ He just wants to -- __eot__ -- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
We gotta roll, Stevie... __eot__ I'll be there. __eot__ They're waitin' man. __eot__ I'll be there, goddamn it!
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean... __eot__ Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
You can't talk about my brother like that... __eot__ Here we go...
Stephen, what are you doing here? __eot__ Fixing my roof. __eot__ It's not your roof anymore.
Where's Sean? __eot__ He's got piano lessons. __eot__ Oh yeah? How's he doing? __eot__ He's going to be a fireman. __eot__ Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried... __eot__ Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this. __eot__ I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it -- __eot__ -- You remember. __eot__ Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something. __eot__ The great communicator. __eot__ Sorry I hit Jackson. __eot__ He deserved it. He was born deserving it. __eot__ He treats you okay? __eot__ Okay. __eot__ I treated you better. __eot__ You treated me like shit.
You want some coffee? __eot__ Coffee? Nah, I gotta go. __eot__ What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing? __eot__ He's out. __eot__ I know he's out, but how's he doing? __eot__ Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror. __eot__ Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right. __eot__ Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong. __eot__ Yeah? When was the last time? __eot__ In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't... __eot__ You can't keep being his father...
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep... __eot__ What's wrong? __eot__ I...  It used to be, when I was a kid, what meant most to me about this job was there were no ifs. Life and death, right and wrong. When someone called the fire department, we came... Those guys don't know how much I love them... You don't leave people hanging... cause that's what it's all about. It's loyalty. It's 'till death do us part. Isn't that what you heard?... It's you go, we go... Cause without that, it's the end of families, it's the end of the fire department... and when the fire department stops coming... that's the end of the fucking world...  I'm sorry I came, Helen, it's just... it's just there's nobody I can talk to...  I miss you.
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat. __eot__ Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
Look, I'm sorry I -- __eot__ -- No, that's okay. It's just Sean... __eot__ -- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano. __eot__ I don't want to confuse him, Stephen.
They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it. __eot__ Putty? On both doors? __eot__ There's something else kinda interesting...
Anyway, down here, take a look... __eot__ McCaffrey, hold this for us.
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it. __eot__ Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago. __eot__ Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire. __eot__ What the hell was it doing in the fire? __eot__ That's your job.
Shadow. __eot__ How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable? __eot__ Didn't think you'd make it. __eot__ Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal. __eot__ Who's this? __eot__ He works for me. __eot__ Is he a fireman?  I like firemen. __eot__ You like everybody, Ronald.
You don't know him. __eot__ I know you.
Knock it off. Now. __eot__ Tell him about me, Shadow? __eot__ Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it? __eot__ Did he tell you how we finally met? __eot__ Nobody cares, Ronald. __eot__ Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow. You're depriving our famous young friend here...
Sure Ronald? You're ready alright. __eot__ Absolutely.
-- Burn them. __eot__ And old ladies? __eot__ -- Burn them. __eot__ And the world -- the whole world. __eot__ -- Burn it all.
Got a cause? __eot__ Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke. __eot__ The glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home.
I'm working on it. __eot__ I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening? __eot__ ...He wasn't listening to the right thing... __eot__ What do you listen to, Stephen? __eot__ You don't know... nobody knows... __eot__ I might.
It knows us. This one knows us. __eot__ I need that report, Lt.
Alderman Swayzak. __eot__ Investigator Rimgale. __eot__ I need to get in the trunk.
Inspector. __eot__ Alderman.
When are you going to catch the prick that's doing this, Don? __eot__ "Don?" __eot__ Don't you have any leads at all? __eot__ No Marty, I don't.
We still haven't found a connection between the victims. __eot__ Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise! __eot__ Holcomb? I didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet.
Is there a connection between them, Alderman? __eot__ Just catch the son of a bitch.
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'? __eot__ Investigator...
I'm a little busy right now -- __eot__ This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --
I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant! __eot__ Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man! __eot__ It's nothing. This is New York, man...  Oh -- I forgot. Bowtay needs some cash to buy her new acting headshots out of the developers. It's a good investment, man. She could make serious money!
Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in -- __eot__ Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't. __eot__ They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would. __eot__ Susie's not a virgin anymore. __eot__ She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ. __eot__ Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way. __eot__ I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God? __eot__ What's to believe? __eot__ That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins.
People. __eot__ You believe that man is the be-all and end-all? __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's -- it's someone who wants to kill me.  You gotta believe me! __eot__ Why?
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands. __eot__ Who? __eot__ Those fucking Mob assholes.
C'mere. You got some good blow, right? __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ Then c'mere. I got something for you.
First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  First time shooting up? __eot__ Nah... __eot__ Sure it is. You're a virgin. Just like that nun. And I'm gonna rape you.
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man... __eot__ Who? __eot__ A wiseguy. Paying 100 Grand for the rapists if I turn then over direct to him.
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread... __eot__ You mean you could use it.
I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win! __eot__ "The Strawberries"? __eot__ The Mets. So anyway, chalk up another 180 G for the Game. Jesus Christ! That's almost half a million dollars. Ariane! Wait. That's not good enough, I'll ask the shithead for 280 G for the kids. Then it'll be a perfect 500 thousand. Yeah. Perfect. 280 G for the kids. Yeah, it's good I prepared, or I wouldn't have thought to --
How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track? __eot__ I'm a Catholic.
You took the chalice. __eot__ Yes. __eot__ You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again. __eot__ Yes.
Are you all right, honey? __eot__ I was gonna bring it back myself.
So what are you doing here? __eot__ He wants to know who brought in the chalice. __eot__ That's no mystery. Julio and Paolo brought it in,  You don't want to hurt those boys, do you? I mean, they sure as Hell have got something coming, but it ain't what the Law wants to give them. You understand?  No. How could you understand.
That stuff'll kill you quick, man. __eot__ What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you? __eot__ The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide. __eot__ Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
How are you doing, man? __eot__ Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right? __eot__ Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow. __eot__ I know.  Take care of yourself, man, OK? Be cool.
I forgive you. __eot__ Me? __eot__ I forgive you. __eot__ You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad. __eot__ I forgive you. __eot__ Please. Please don't forgive me. I've always hated you for that.
I forgive you. __eot__ Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me! __eot__ I forgive you. __eot__ Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?
I forgive you. __eot__ Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I --
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good. __eot__ I forgive you.
Large? __eot__ All right, cop. I want my money. __eot__ It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game. __eot__ What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game? __eot__ Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet. __eot__ Let me think about it. __eot__ There's nothing to think about. Either you put in my bet or you ain't getting nothing.
Oh, really? __eot__ Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop! __eot__ OK, cop. I want you to give yourself and your friends on the force a message. Tell them I've got my own reasons to be very interested in whomever did the job on the nuns. I'll double the Church reward if you bring those punks direct to me. 100 G cash. Get it?
Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine. __eot__ Yeah, sucker. You better be there!
I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the $800. __eot__ All right. What are you gonna do? __eot__ I want 15 on the Mets. __eot__ How about 7 1/2?
Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit. Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are a fucking lock. I wanna make some money. __eot__ Are you sure? __eot__ Yeah. I'm sure.
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do? __eot__ I wanna go double or nothing on the next game. __eot__ Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind? __eot__ I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money __eot__ Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it! __eot__ There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out.
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac! __eot__ That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
Do you have the money? __eot__ What money? __eot__ Don't bullshit me.
I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone. __eot__ This psycho can. __eot__ Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game. __eot__ You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that! __eot__ Uh-uh. I'm gonna win. Just make sure the bet gets in.
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids -- __eot__ Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and -- __eot__ He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it? __eot__ I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.
How's the case going? __eot__ What case? __eot__ The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember? __eot__ Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet. __eot__ That 50 G could help you --
Get this, man. I was at the game today. Face to fucking face with Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him strikeout. And you know what? He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood for the very first time that -- __eot__ You've really got a problem.
-- that there was never any other way it could have gone.  Never any other way. So you had better just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 on the last game. The Big One. Come on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking what? __eot__ Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's number You call him yourself and tell him wnat you want.
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil. __eot__ Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --
Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God? __eot__ It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt. __eot__ I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God? __eot__ I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer. __eot__ As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father -- __eot__ Yes, Sister? __eot__ Yesterday morning, God gave me but one chance to use something else to serve Him. Not my arms or my legs, but something I used for the first time, for the last time, and will never use again. My vagina.
Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys. __eot__ You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint. __eot__ How 'bout...
BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more. __eot__ B-L-A-K it is.
Keep trying. __eot__ I'm on it.
...Benedict Arnold... __eot__ ...that simpleton is holding back the race.  They got rid of us and keep those two buffoons, Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat, y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
Same thing, y'knowwhatI'msayin', y'knowwhatI'msayin'! __eot__ We know.  We know.  Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  Not this injustice. Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons iz ill. __eot__ 1/16, tru' 'dat.  True 'dat.

You truly are a dancing fool. __eot__ Yo Black, you looking for trouble.
Everybody say Ho! __eot__ Ho! __eot__ That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout! That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout!  I want to be the first to welcome you to the second taping of Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show.
My name is Honeycutt and I want to try something different.  Can you do this for me? __eot__ Yeah! __eot__ I'm gonna start a chant and I want y'all to follow me.  Let's make our own 2 real coons know you're ready to start the show.
C'mon.  It's easy.  It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word.  Everybody go it? __eot__ YEAH! __eot__ Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS! __eot__ Let's go NIGGERS.
Let's go niggers! __eot__ Louder.  They can't hear you.
You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary. __eot__ I didn't mean to scare you like that. __eot__ Well you did. __eot__ Give me some? __eot__ I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius. __eot__ Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is... __eot__ I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius. __eot__ BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.
Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece. __eot__ I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up? __eot__ Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies? __eot__ So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo. __eot__ Who are you revolting against? __eot__ We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A. __eot__ Please. __eot__ If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again? __eot__ Delacroix. __eot__ Yeah, him. __eot__ What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's. __eot__ C'mon, why not?  The Monkees had a show.  Look at all that other junk that's on TV.  We got underground cult following.
You don't have the demographics. __eot__ So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'. __eot__ That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else. __eot__ There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga. __eot__ If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house. __eot__ My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out. __eot__ That's mighty black of you.
The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's. __eot__ What's your name? __eot__ My righteous name is BIG BLACK. __eot__ And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today? __eot__ We gonna drop some knowledge, wisdom and understanding.  The Mau- Mau's, we be scientists.  We drop science.
We're ready when you are. __eot__ Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.
Our first caller is Big Black from Brooklyn.  Go 'head. __eot__ Microphone check, one, two.  One, two.  Yo Tavis, I be lovin' yo show but Mantan you is foul.  Why you perpetrating?  You a sellout.
And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do? __eot__ What do I do? __eot__ What do you do? __eot__ I'm a revolutionary.
And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better... __eot__ Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there.  We can all agree to disagree without making threats.
Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood. __eot__ You might be right. __eot__ Why are you smiling so?
I'm not smiling. __eot__ Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins. __eot__ It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face. __eot__ No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit. __eot__ Certified ladies' man, huh? __eot__ She's also moorish.
What's that? __eot__ Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE. __eot__ Seconds and thirds, too. __eot__ Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual. __eot__ You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff. __eot__ Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.
DeLa - what's the matter with you. __eot__ You ain't happy about the green light?
What's wrong with him? __eot__ Must be the pressure.
Please, have a seat. __eot__ Sloan never told us she had friends like you. __eot__ In fact, we never knew she had any friends period.
Why they gotta make my nose so big? __eot__ Look at my lips.
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid. __eot__ What are you talkin' about? __eot__ Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid. __eot__ Meaning? __eot__ I'm out. __eot__ Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway. __eot__ So that's what you been doing? __eot__ Damn skippy. __eot__ You're in this up till ya neck. __eot__ Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players. __eot__ You can walk away.  We both can. __eot__ Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent. __eot__ I'm so tired of you running that. I always worked hard for you.  You think I'm a leech, a kling-on, I quit.
Good morning, Cheeba. __eot__ Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot. __eot__ De-la-croix. __eot__ Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you. __eot__ You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short? __eot__ No offense. __eot__ Manray needs a job.
I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money. __eot__ How much? __eot__ First things first.  I have to know if Manray is up for this.
What kind of show is this gonna be? __eot__ Different.
What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time? __eot__ You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
Nice to meet you. __eot__ And this is Manray.
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one. __eot__ We might need some mo' money behind this. __eot__ That can be done.
I'm starvin' like Marvin. __eot__ My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon. __eot__ Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO. __eot__ Did we get our bill yet?
Ahh, the luxuries of life. __eot__ Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me. __eot__ Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit. __eot__ And I'm the feet. __eot__ Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing. __eot__ I'm tired of waiting.
We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings? __eot__ Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week. __eot__ We was coming to see you. __eot__ If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food? __eot__ We're starving.
That ain't funny. __eot__ DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street. __eot__ Well do something about it.
My tap shoes. __eot__ EUREKA!!
What do I have to do? __eot__ Some tap dancing, some singing. __eot__ Where do I sign?
How different? __eot__ Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other. __eot__ DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!! __eot__ That's right.  Money turns the wheel.
I would like to change your name. __eot__ To what? __eot__ You're now Mantan. __eot__ Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.
I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind. __eot__ Why? __eot__ You have to start getting into your character.
Mantan? __eot__ Mantan!!
I'm not playin' myself no mo'. __eot__ How you sound? __eot__ I won't do it anymore. __eot__ Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional. __eot__ I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing. __eot__ No costume.  No blackface.
Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings? __eot__ Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored. __eot__ No matter how sexist or racist the material may be? __eot__ Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God? __eot__ But the line has to be drawn. __eot__ Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up. __eot__ Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust? __eot__ Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon.
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago. __eot__ I'm sorry I'm late. __eot__ Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone? __eot__ I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
Four minutes ago. __eot__ So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you? __eot__ I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.
Do you know what C.P. Time is? __eot__ C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.
I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting. __eot__ I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed. __eot__ Forget it.  I believe you're my most creative person I've got on staff.  You're hip.  You know what's happening.  I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me.
I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I. __eot__ I would prefer you not use that word in my presence. __eot__ NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.
The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again. __eot__ I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom. __eot__ I'm telling you it's not.
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic... __eot__ ...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk. __eot__ I've never been given a fair shot. __eot__ You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white. __eot__ I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think? __eot__ That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water. __eot__ I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want. __eot__ You will or you'll be back at BET so quick you'll never know what hit you.  I need a mid-season replacement and pronto.  It will be on the fast track.
What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days? __eot__ Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right. __eot__ It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.
We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you. __eot__ I'm wid it. __eot__ I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing. __eot__ Go on.  Good so far. __eot__ I know you're familiar with minstrel shows.  They came about at the turn of the 19th century.  It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air.  Carol Burnett? HeeHaw?
Word!!! __eot__ So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium. __eot__ The name of the show? __eot__ It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW. __eot__ I'm lovin' it.  You know how I know? Because I'm getting a boner, my Johnson is hard, no disrespect my sister.
I'm feelin' dis'! __eot__ It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial. __eot__ Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance? __eot__ I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go. __eot__ Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose?  Which one is Mantan again?
That's a great handle. __eot__ Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire. __eot__ I want you take it there.  All the way to the edge and back.
Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo. __eot__ What are there character traits? __eot__ Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky. __eot__ Exactly! __eot__ Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire. __eot__ And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick? __eot__ Yep, you guessed it. __eot__ This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."
Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on. __eot__ Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.
Negroes would be in an uproar. __eot__ So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing. __eot__ Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet. __eot__ Who are the other characters? __eot__ Do we have characters?  How about Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and how could we forget Aunt Jemima.
We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting? __eot__ In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's." __eot__ Ya first bad move.  Projects been done.  That's one of the problems now, everything, movies, TV, are set in the urban jungle, da hood. That's so tired.  Mantan's Millennium Minstrel Show should be set on a plantation.  In Alabama.
And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive. __eot__ I don't know about that plantation angle. __eot__ What are you talkin' 'bout?  It's the move.  Stay wid me now.  We're movin' fast.  What does everybody else think about this?
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook! __eot__ We think so. __eot__ Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do?
I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.  This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing "Amos and Andy."  Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain. __eot__ To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  It's un-American.  I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after. __eot__ I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video. __eot__ You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot? __eot__ I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind. __eot__ Besides, what does he know about Negroes? __eot__ Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless. __eot__ What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video? __eot__ If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot. __eot__ That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything? __eot__ No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!! __eot__ Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone. __eot__ Dunwitty, don't leave.
I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation! __eot__ Calm down, please.
I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from. __eot__ We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier. __eot__ Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut. __eot__ I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo? __eot__ They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together. __eot__ This has to be a big mistake. __eot__ The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street. __eot__ Hold on a sec, I got a call. __eot__ Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call. __eot__ I gots to go, it's my Moms. __eot__ I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
What do you want? __eot__ I want to speak with you. __eot__ Go away, unless you got my money. __eot__ It's me, Peerless.
Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya. __eot__ It's been a long time. __eot__ Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT. __eot__ Pleased to meet you.
Good woman.  I trained her right. __eot__ Daddy, she's younger than me. __eot__ My game is still strong.  No Viagra for me, don't need no chemicals. Just my tonic.
Purely for medicinal purposes. __eot__ I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink. __eot__ How did you end up here? __eot__ How did I end up at the third rate chittlin' circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell, Virginny? Is that what you're asking ya Daddy?
That's what I'm askin'. __eot__ Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do. __eot__ Daddy, it can't be just because of that.  There had to be other factors.
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic. __eot__ Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back? __eot__ All I know is what happened to me. All that other mess I just file into the "life's too short" category.
Enough about me, what's happening with you? __eot__ The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.
Dem white boys giving you a hard time? __eot__ Nuthin' I can't handle. __eot__ The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle. __eot__ Where do you go from here? __eot__ Three nights Charleston, South Carolina. __eot__ I didn't mean that, in life. __eot__ In life?  I'ma keep on living, having a good drink, got me a good young woman, make a couple of dollars and make people laugh. Haven't I always tol' you all nigga's are entertainers?  The question is what are you gonna do, Peerless?
Let's get him over to the bed. __eot__ Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless, you're a good son, I love you.  You never gave me no trouble.
I love you too, Daddy. __eot__ Always keep 'em laughing.
Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about. __eot__ Is that so?
How long has my father been like this? __eot__ Not that often.  He was excited to see you. __eot__ So he drank himself into a stuper? __eot__ The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it. __eot__ So what's up with you? __eot__ I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it. __eot__ Your father is proud of you.
He never showed it. __eot__ He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you.
How was it? __eot__ Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting? __eot__ Nobody told me anything. __eot__ What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this? __eot__ It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known.
Manray! __eot__ Manray!
How did you know? __eot__ It hit me like a ton of bricks. __eot__ How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary. __eot__ The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?
Manray was under our nose the whole time. __eot__ Do you know how you will use him? __eot__ Not yet, but this thing will never get made.
You lost me. __eot__ Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point. __eot__ What point is that? __eot__ The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons. __eot__ Sounds risky to me. __eot__ You getting cold feet? __eot__ I'm in till the end. __eot__ Good.  I'm going to need your support. __eot__ Can't you just quit?  Walk away? __eot__ And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.
Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death. __eot__ Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.
Hello. __eot__ This is Cheeba.
You okay? __eot__ I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
What is your problem? __eot__ My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW. __eot__ Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made? __eot__ It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money. __eot__ Fuck da money.  Why do through all this effort?  Why?  Are you looking for love from Dunwitty?  For respect?  Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you.  So now what are you gonna do?
Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous. __eot__ What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up? __eot__ I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place. __eot__ Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.
Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins. __eot__ Hello. __eot__ I've never worked with any of you and you've never worked with me so we'll be starting from scratch. I'm a fair person, a straight shooter and I don't hold my tongue. Everybody up in here should know I had nothing to do with you being hired.
This is the group I was telling you about. __eot__ Which one is your brother? __eot__ The big one.
You've said that already. __eot__ I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
Just want to say good luck. __eot__ Break a leg.
Your life will never be the same. __eot__ Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready. __eot__ We both lied to him. __eot__ What do you want me to say? __eot__ Just don't lie to me.
Same here. __eot__ The pleasure is mine.
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you. __eot__ C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.
Who's side are you on? __eot__ I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest. __eot__ Everybody shut up.
So you have your small victory, now what? __eot__ A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
What is this? __eot__ A gift. __eot__ For what? __eot__ No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
The Jolly Nigger Bank. __eot__ This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century. __eot__ Thanks. __eot__ I thought it was appropiate. __eot__ Is that good or bad? __eot__ It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles. __eot__ How so? __eot__ To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
Why'd you do that? __eot__ I don't want to hear it. __eot__ How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out? __eot__ You're the one that put us together. We're friends. __eot__ That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so. __eot__ He's just playing big brother. __eot__ Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan? __eot__ Please don't go there. __eot__ Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up. __eot__ I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think. __eot__ Do you have to be so damn forthright?
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light. __eot__ Light? __eot__ That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood. __eot__ You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
This is crazy. __eot__ That's why it will be so much fun.
That was a mistake, but I don't regret it. __eot__ The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore. __eot__ Work related or otherwise?
Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU. __eot__ DeLa, kiss my big black ass. __eot__ And that's how you got me in the first place.
Don't make me have to use this. __eot__ I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me. __eot__ Give me the gun.
Yes, your name? __eot__ He, I'm Mona. __eot__ Hi, Mona. __eot__ I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness. __eot__ Oh, is that what I'm doing?
This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in.  Could Don King be near?  Good thing Sloan had my back.  She's my rock.  This was going to be a whole lot of work. __eot__ David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud. __eot__ I've always liked the format of Rowan and Martin's "LAUGH-IN."
I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on. __eot__ Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure. __eot__ I didn't mean it to sound like that.
That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life? __eot__ Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you. __eot__ The point I'm trying to make is that this is a blessing.  It's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way.
Can I kiss you too? __eot__ Naw.  I'll take the zero. __eot__ You feel good, not nervous? __eot__ I feel fine. __eot__ Not nervous?  Relaxed? __eot__ Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
So they can be on TV. __eot__ You sound like the media. __eot__ This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow. __eot__ Same thing Giuliani said. __eot__ Tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to animals or some sex scandal.  Besides, there is no such thing as bad publicity.
No joke.  Serious. __eot__ Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill. __eot__ In time.
What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me? __eot__ No. __eot__ You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing? __eot__ Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'? __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ And now is definitely not the time to bitch up.
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan. __eot__ What you did is dead wrong. __eot__ Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired. __eot__ Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met. __eot__ Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity. __eot__ I don't believe it. __eot__ Do I have to spell it out for you? In fact, go ask Sloan yourself.
Mantan, we got a show to tape. __eot__ My name is Manray, goddamnit. __eot__ Kook and the Gang, it's Manray. Let's do the taping.  You go back to your dressing room, get dressed and blacken up.
You must think I'm some kind of fool. __eot__ It looks delicious. __eot__ You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong. __eot__ C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff. __eot__ I said no such thing.  All I said is that something must be wrong.
How's the food? __eot__ Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot. __eot__ That's wonderful.  Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your own?
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show. __eot__ If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless. __eot__ Mommy, please don't call me that. __eot__ Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate. __eot__ I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy? __eot__ I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons? __eot__ To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons? __eot__ Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already. __eot__ Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something. __eot__ I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.
Peerless, your father called. __eot__ I'll be right over.
He wants you to come and see him. __eot__ He said that? __eot__ Yes he did. __eot__ Where is he? __eot__ He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia. __eot__ I can't go all the way down south.
Richmond is not all the way down south. __eot__ I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you. __eot__ Regardless, he still is your father. __eot__ It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off. __eot__ Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success. __eot__ C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present. __eot__ Peerless, last time, go see your father.
I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery. __eot__ You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me? __eot__ Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success. __eot__ Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called? __eot__ No. __eot__ Not at all? __eot__ You know how your Daddy is. __eot__ If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan. __eot__ I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother? __eot__ Soon.
Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you? __eot__ I just turned twenty.
Where are you from? __eot__ Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland. __eot__ Finland. __eot__ You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes? __eot__ Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before? __eot__ What's a Negro.
A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination. __eot__ Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!! __eot__ Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No? __eot__ Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO. __eot__ Thank you for correcting my ignorance.  I'm looking forward to working side by side with you.  I feel we make a good team.
How did you get this gig? __eot__ My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot? __eot__ This is a TV show, not a music video. __eot__ Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no? __eot__ This is a travesty.  A debacle.
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show. __eot__ Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz. __eot__ First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy. __eot__ The best defense is offense.
The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't it?  Number One.  We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras.  Two. Let the audience decide.  Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four.  Who determines what is black? Five.  Mantan is a satire.  Six. If they can't take a joke, "F" 'em. __eot__ We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing.
Let Myrna finish. __eot__ Thank you.  And always smile.
Yes you! __eot__ This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
I never had a really real pair before. __eot__ You've never had any formal training, either? __eot__ Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself. __eot__ I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while. __eot__ You sing and dance? __eot__ A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies. __eot__ So what's up with you and DeLa? __eot__ What do you mean? __eot__ Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.
No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant. __eot__ I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that. __eot__ If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you. __eot__ You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing. __eot__ Why do you say that?  You've never seen me. __eot__ I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world. __eot__ I envy you.  That's the way I want to feel about my work.
Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in. __eot__ Tavis, thank you for having me. __eot__ Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here. __eot__ I'm more comfortable around my people. __eot__ Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this? __eot__ Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins."
Money and nothing else? __eot__ Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game. __eot__ Is it inevitable that the game plays you? __eot__ No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better. __eot__ Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort? __eot__ I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time. __eot__ I admit, that's a very hard thing to do.  Quickly let's go to the phones before we pay the bills and hear from our proud sponsors, DA BOMB.  125% PURE PLEASURE MALT LIQUOR.  IT MAKES YOU WANNA GET YA FREAK ON AND TIMMI HILLNIGGER. 125% AUTHENTIC GIT-TOE GEAR WHEN YOU WANT TO BE GIT-TOED FABULOUS.
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat. __eot__ And this is my very best friend Mantan.
We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem... __eot__ ...the big apple, New York, New York. __eot__ To come back to our roots. __eot__ Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's. __eot__ No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton? __eot__ Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan. __eot__ Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat. __eot__ Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.
Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat. __eot__ You tellin' the truth. __eot__ Go to your windows and yell out, scream with all the life you can muster up inside your assaulted, bruised and battered bodies.  I'M SICK AND TIRED OF NIGGERS AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE!
Y'know my lady Lucindy? __eot__ The one with da big... __eot__ Not her, the one with the little... __eot__ Oh her. __eot__ Tomorrow is her birthday and I want to get her something really nice, like a...
No, not that.  How 'bout... __eot__ She hates dem. __eot__ Too bad.  How 'bout a dress? __eot__ Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy... __eot__ Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose... __eot__ ...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose. __eot__ That'll work.  I just bought one for myself.
Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for... __eot__ I thought you got rid of... __eot__ ...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round... __eot__ ...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than... __eot__ ...aconite get it dat cheap. __eot__ I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner. __eot__ We should go out on a double date.
I heard ya lady is wild. __eot__ No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit. __eot__ Oh, because on our first date, she let me... __eot__ ...no, she didn't... __eot__ ...yes she did. __eot__ ...I heard different, thought that was... __eot__ ...not that time... __eot__ So when are you comin' to pick us up? __eot__ Around... __eot__ ...too early... __eot__ ...then what about... __eot__ ...too late, maybe around... __eot__ ...perfect... __eot__ That's what I like about you and me. We git along... __eot__ ...like macaroni and cheese... __eot__ ...like grits and butter... __eot__ ...like fried and chicken...
I fell out of my bed last night. __eot__ You slept too near where you got in? __eot__ I slept too near where I fell out. __eot__ You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words? __eot__ Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut? __eot__ Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me. __eot__ Ain't Jemima on the pancake box? __eot__ Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately. __eot__ How be dat? __eot__ I don't know who I am. __eot__ Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle. __eot__ Years ago I married a widow who had a grown-up daughter.  My daddy visited us often, fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her. Thusly he became my son-in-law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father's wife. Soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son, which of course was my father's brother in-law and my uncle, for he was the brother of my step-mother.  My father's wife also became the mother of a son.  He was of course my brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter.  Accordingly, my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother's mother.
Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather. __eot__ Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper.
I feel a song a comin' on. __eot__ A song a comin' I feel.
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways. __eot__ Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
A lot? __eot__ Enough.
So what's up with you? __eot__ What do you want to know? __eot__ The good stuff. __eot__ I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler. __eot__ What else? __eot__ Are you trying to rap to me?
This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny. __eot__ Sloan, I got it like 'dat. __eot__ Oh you do, huh? __eot__ Just a little something' somethin'. __eot__ I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'. __eot__ Gots no intention of ending up broke. __eot__ Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist. __eot__ No, before my time. __eot__ You don't read, do you? __eot__ Never read a book in my whole life. __eot__ Maybe you need to start. __eot__ Maybe I need to do a lot of things. __eot__ Bert Williams and the rest, they had to black up.  They had no choice.  They were considered 3/5ths of a human being.  Did you know that's written in the Constitution of the United States?
Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix. __eot__ I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt. __eot__ We can look out for ourselves.
Why don't you call him? __eot__ For what?  He left.  Not me.
You're sure this is a good idea. __eot__ My people love me.
I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on. __eot__ Y'know what? __eot__ What? __eot__ You look beautiful like that.
How did you get this gig? __eot__ Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position. __eot__ You leave something out? __eot__ After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant. __eot__ And? __eot__ And what? __eot__ Stop playing me Sloan. __eot__ Just ask me what you want to know. __eot__ Oh, you gonna make me say it. __eot__ Say what, Manray? __eot__ Did you ever sleep with DeLa? __eot__ We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned. __eot__ Aw, c'mon. __eot__ That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I.
So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass. __eot__ Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa? __eot__ Don't try to change to the subject. __eot__ Why don't you answer? __eot__ I know I won't be your puppet. __eot__ You can go now. __eot__ I wuz leaving anyway, for good.
Good day to you, young sir. __eot__ Good morning. __eot__ Where are you bound for? __eot__ That is none of your business. __eot__ Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel? __eot__ Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I -- __eot__ If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.
Both of us ride home with Best here. __eot__ I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I. __eot__ You know the use of arms very well, Best, and no one can doubt your courage; but Michael and I will see you home for all that.
There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose? __eot__ Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan? __eot__ Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the pistols.  God bless you, my boy; and when I count three, fire.
Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here? __eot__ I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir. __eot__ Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones. __eot__ It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir. __eot__ Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking. __eot__ I never was more in earnest.
My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him. __eot__ What is your uncle's name? __eot__ O'Grady. __eot__ Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...
This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner? __eot__ This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach. __eot__ Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe?
Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you. __eot__ The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard. __eot__ The people are great farmers, as well as inn-keepers.
Where's the beauty you promised me? __eot__ It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly. __eot__ I have acted as I think fit. __eot__ Sir, I'm a British officer. __eot__ It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up? __eot__ Neither!
Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein. __eot__ How do you do, sir?
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion. __eot__ Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas. __eot__ What is the service, sir? __eot__ There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well? __eot__ Only a very little, as soldiers do. __eot__ I had thought you more expert.  You must find out if the Chevalier cheats.  He sees the English and Austrian envoys continually, and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house.  Find out what they talk of, for how much each plays, especially if any of them play on parole.  If you are able to, read his private letters, though about those which go to the post, you need not trouble yourself -- we look at them there.  But never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes, and by what channel or messenger.  He sleeps with the keys of his dispatch-box with a string around his neck -- twenty frederics, if you get an impression of the keys.
What are the Chevalier's intentions? __eot__ I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
Has he sent the challenge yet? __eot__ Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on. __eot__ And his baggage? __eot__ Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn.  You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival.  We must force that box.  You are a clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago.
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family. __eot__ The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her! __eot__ Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.
A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father. __eot__ And so I am. __eot__ And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder? __eot__ Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting? __eot__ Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow. __eot__ He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him. __eot__ In faith, I believe you are not; for a lad I never saw more game in my life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy. You're after my own soul.  As long as Jack Grogan lives, you shall never want a friend or a second.
Have you taken my message to him? __eot__ The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now. __eot__ My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second? __eot__ Your cousins go out with him.
That's a very handsome sword you have there. __eot__ It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize. __eot__ And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world. __eot__ I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body. __eot__ Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword. __eot__ I'll match any man with the sword. __eot__ But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now. __eot__ Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years. __eot__ It must have been some other gate.
Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off. __eot__ A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family. __eot__ I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin. __eot__ I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office. __eot__ We must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married to "Brown Bess."
I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown. __eot__ Is Miss Dugan well? __eot__ There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy. __eot__ Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief? __eot__ She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best. __eot__ Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?! __eot__ No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made. __eot__ The coward! __eot__ He has paid off your uncle's mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach- and-six.  That coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family.  Faith, the business was well done.  Your cousins, Michael and Harry, never let him out of their sight, though he was for deserting to England, until the marriage was completed, and the happy couple off on their road to Dublin.  Are you in want of cash, my boy?  You may draw upon me, for I got a couple of hundred out of Master Best for my share and, while they last, you shall never want.
Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife. __eot__ I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls. __eot__ Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father? __eot__ Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family. __eot__ Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset. __eot__ Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown. __eot__ I have heard of them.
Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah? __eot__ Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland! __eot__ You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver! __eot__ Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body. __eot__ Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as well as you, Mr. Roderick James. Ah!  You change color, do you?  Your secret is known, is it?  You come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis; I take you to my tradesmen, who give you credit.  I accept your note for near two hundred pounds, and what do I find?  A fraud.
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me. __eot__ I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated? __eot__ I don't know. __eot__ Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won. __eot__ Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time. __eot__ Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation. __eot__ I have said all there is to be said. I am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish.  Good night.
Where is my rascal, Lazlo? __eot__ I will let down the steps for your honor.
Good gracious!  What is this? __eot__ You are going to drive to the frontier. __eot__ It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house. __eot__ I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not. __eot__ Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand. __eot__ Your honor must lower his voice. __eot__ All Europe shall hear of this! __eot__ As you please.
I have no luggage. __eot__ The gentleman has nothing contraband.
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended? __eot__ Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi? __eot__ Yes, sir. __eot__ You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach. __eot__ Herr Seebach was a very kind employer. __eot__ For whom else have you worked? __eot__ No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins. __eot__ Who else can give me information about you? __eot__ Only the agency of servants.
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood. __eot__ I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
The cards are now my only livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do you understand the cards? __eot__ I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill. __eot__ We will practice in the mornings, my boy, and I'll put you up to a thing or two worth knowing.
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost. __eot__ Have no fear.  It will come out well for me. __eot__ I believe they will deport you. __eot__ I have faced that problem before. __eot__ But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me? __eot__ Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go. __eot__ But how, sir?
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden? __eot__ Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask? __eot__ Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.
It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman. __eot__ To risk one's life against such people is an imposition. __eot__ I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him. __eot__ Certain? __eot__ Perfectly certain, because I shall make him tremble.
I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady. __eot__ Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love? __eot__ Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals. __eot__ Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her. __eot__ Then you yield to me. __eot__ On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you. __eot__ Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs. __eot__ That is a trifle strong. __eot__ Take to your legs, low Irish dog.
No. __eot__ Have you had one? __eot__ Never. __eot__ But, for a time... a passing fancy? __eot__ Not even that. __eot__ How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you? __eot__ Not one. __eot__ Have you not a man whom you value? __eot__ That man has, perhaps, not yet been born. __eot__ What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention? __eot__ Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved. __eot__ Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty. __eot__ Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it. __eot__ It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love. __eot__ But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune. __eot__ That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love. __eot__ It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last. __eot__ I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk. __eot__ A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws. __eot__ I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men. __eot__ How so? __eot__ By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.
You want my heart? __eot__ It is my only object. __eot__ To make me wretched in two weeks. __eot__ To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands. __eot__ The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me. __eot__ Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent. __eot__ But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you, for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer.
Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are? __eot__ With a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight.
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness? __eot__ Then I will respectfully take leave of her. __eot__ You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree? __eot__ Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived. __eot__ Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end? __eot__ I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.
Will we always leave it at this? __eot__ Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it. __eot__ I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away. __eot__ Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires. __eot__ Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew. __eot__ My husband has convinced me of the contrary. __eot__ Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty.
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it. __eot__ O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes. __eot__ Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy. __eot__ As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much. __eot__ We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"
My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me: __eot__ Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool. __eot__ Old fool!
I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases. __eot__ Agreed. __eot__ Do you see the gate at the end of the field?  The first to touch it will be the winner.
I feel the ribbon. __eot__ Then you must get it.
Why are you shaking? __eot__ With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night. __eot__ I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set. __eot__ Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden? __eot__ I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him? __eot__ But you refused me, Dorothy. __eot__ Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world. __eot__ If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is. __eot__ But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side. __eot__ I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them. __eot__ What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me? __eot__ Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us. __eot__ Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare to do any such thing on Daisy. There's the captain's horse, Black George, I've heard say that Captain Bes --
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted? __eot__ Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend? __eot__ As much as possible. __eot__ As much as possible? __eot__ Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly. __eot__ All the same, you must name an amount. __eot__ It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more. __eot__ All right, five hundred guineas.
And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table. __eot__ Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs? __eot__ By name only. __eot__ Well, sir, this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's closet, and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy.  I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get.
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove? __eot__ Yes! __eot__ Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you point by point.  The King is exceedingly averse to make peers, as you know.  Your claim, as you call them, have been laid before him, and His Majesty's gracious reply was, that you were the most impudent man in his dominions, and merited a halter, rather than a coronet.  As for withdrawing your support from us, you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please.  And, now, as I have a great deal of occupation, perhaps you will do me the favor to retire, or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which I can oblige you.
Does this assignment interest you? __eot__ Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
Was he cheated? __eot__ In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly. __eot__ Hmm-mmmm.
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible. __eot__ The Prince left him only that choice.
The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country. __eot__ When is he to go?
Then this must be done tomorrow. __eot__ What is to be done?
What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship? __eot__ Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin.  My chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but, on the contrary, wished him "good luck."
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much? __eot__ Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me. __eot__ I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap. __eot__ But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...? __eot__ O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home? __eot__ That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum. __eot__ You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.
I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance. __eot__ Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed. __eot__ Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one. __eot__ I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe. __eot__ There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature. __eot__ Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious? __eot__ May I be quite frank with you? __eot__ Yes, of course. __eot__ Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital. __eot__ I see. __eot__ When I asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship's assurances, they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth, in their presence, at their counting-house in Birchin Lane, London.  I requested they come here, and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to London, but they declined, saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to Castle Hackton to negotiate, as they were aware of how other respectable parties, such as Messrs. Sharp and Salomon had been treated here.
Did you buy the horse, papa? __eot__ Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week. __eot__ But I will have it on my birthday, won't I? __eot__ Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
Good night, papa. __eot__ Good night, my little darling. __eot__ Papa? __eot__ Yes? __eot__ One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa? __eot__ What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him. __eot__ Yes, papa.
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels. __eot__ Is he all right, papa? __eot__ Yes, he's fine. __eot__ Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth. __eot__ Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.
Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at me.  Marriage has added forty years to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty.  When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself.  Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable.  Take a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps.  Do anything, but marry. __eot__ Would you have me spend my life all alone? __eot__ In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge. __eot__ The milkmaid's daughter? __eot__ Well, why not a milkmaid's daughter? No man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife's sake; on the contrary, if he selects the animal properly, he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure, but a comfort in his hours of annoyance.  For instance, I have got the gout; who tends me?  A hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power.  My wife never comes near me.  What friend have I?  None in the wide world.  Men of the world, as you and I are, don't make friends, and we are fools for our pains.
Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account. __eot__ Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady? __eot__ I beg your pardon? __eot__ Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool. __eot__ I think, Sir William Cosgrove, you have had too much drink.  Your chaplin, Mr. Hunt, has introduced me into the company of your lady to advise me on a religious matter, of which she is a considerable expert.
Gentlemen, see this amiable youth! He has been troubled by religious scruples, and has flown for refuge to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has asked for advise from my wife, Lady Cosgrove, and between them both, they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith.  Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple? __eot__ Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you? __eot__ He wants to step into my shoes!  He wants to step into my shoes!
Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me? __eot__ Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure? __eot__ I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight? __eot__ Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting. __eot__ Sir, let those laugh that win. __eot__ I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
Charming Schuvaloff. __eot__ Black-eyed Sczortarska. __eot__ Dark Valdez. __eot__ Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight? __eot__ Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight. __eot__ And he doesn't care about me? __eot__ He is only curious to know who you are. __eot__ If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here. __eot__ He loves me, as I love you. __eot__ Will he wish to know the details of this night? __eot__ He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him. __eot__ Tender Hegenheim.
Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me. __eot__ You know that was like a quadruple negative?
Can I at least have a drink? __eot__ It's ten thirty in the morning. __eot__ Yeah, if you've slept. __eot__ You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license. __eot__ Don't you mean "don't need no liquor license not taken away from me"?
Hurricane kept you up, too? __eot__ Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.
Bill Styles... __eot__ Who? __eot__ Old friend. Haven't talked to him in -- 911. Can I use your phone?
Don't you ever point a gun at me! __eot__ I'm -- I'm sorry...
A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you? __eot__ I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right. __eot__ Just safety your shit and get behind me, okay? I'll take care of this.
Fuck, what the fuck is going on -- __eot__ What do we do? __eot__ Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
I don't want to go -- __eot__ Fine.
Did -- did you -- __eot__ It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
What about Pike? __eot__ Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
He is the only one unaccounted for. __eot__ Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
You framed-him... __eot__ None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
This isn't our area. Whose area is this -- __eot__ Can anybody hear me!
Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do? __eot__ We found him like this --
You killed him you fucking faggot -- __eot__ We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
We got -- I don't know, we got separated __eot__ Before or after the explosion?  Mueller -- __eot__ I don't know!
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP. __eot__ HEY!
West was one thing, but this -- __eot__ Shut up, Mueller.
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike? __eot__ We don't know. West is dead.
What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi -- __eot__ What do you mean, alone?
Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do? __eot__ We found him like this...
Yeah, right... __eot__ Shut up.  West's dead.
You too? __eot__ We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
Why not? __eot__ I asked for a policeman. __eot__ You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball? __eot__ It's... too slow. __eot__ Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty. __eot__ I just don't like it. __eot__ What do you like then?
I don't know... I like the Army. __eot__ C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here. __eot__ You did Basic here? __eot__ Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
There's no need... __eot__ They're dead, aren't they?
Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay? __eot__ Okay.
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray? __eot__ I'm not telling you what happened. __eot__ Okay... but I would like to know about the other cadets. What they were like -- nice guys?
Some. __eot__ Tell me about them.
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you? __eot__ Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
You smoke, Ray? __eot__ This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more. __eot__ No, actually, I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some.
Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people! __eot__ That son of a bitch. __eot__ That'd be my reaction too -- __eot__ He's lying. __eot__ Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then -- __eot__ I'm serious --
Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it. __eot__ Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you -- __eot__ I didn't shoot West -- __eot__ Yeah, we know, Pike did.
I apologize -- __eot__ You saw West's body. __eot__ Of course --
And he'd been shot. __eot__ Yeah --
You shot Childs and Nunez. __eot__ They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession. __eot__ You saved Kendall's life -- __eot__ But not Pike's.
Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story -- __eot__ Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.
We're not finished yet -- __eot__ You wanna bet?
We don't need the tapes -- __eot__ Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you? __eot__ We've found all of them.
Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun -- __eot__ Jesus!
He -- He made me do it -- __eot__ Do what? __eot__ Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest. __eot__ And the bodies? __eot__ You won't find them. Won't find West, either. He's too good.
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are... __eot__ Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"... __eot__ He's telling the truth up to a point...
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you? __eot__ No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300. __eot__ Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out. __eot__ There were six of us...
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy? __eot__ Epilepsy. __eot__ Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary. Only reason he enlisted was his father. West didn't section him till last week.
He said he worked there -- __eot__ No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran? __eot__ What business? __eot__ Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
Where? __eot__ The creek bed --
What about the phosphorous grenade? __eot__ One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --
Back up. __eot__ Mueller was alone in the cabin? __eot__ Yeah.
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place? __eot__ Would you have believed me?
Where's the cabin? __eot__ Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too. __eot__ Can't do that now, though, can you?
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it. __eot__ We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself -- __eot__ Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar? Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record? No. You assumed who I was, because I was wearing this uniform. Don't believe me?
Ohhhh, I don't think so... __eot__ How do you know that? __eot__ Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -- no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives... you have nothing.
Cadet, what's your name! __eot__ Sir, Dunbar, sir! __eot__ You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar? __eot__ Sir, yes, sir!
Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear? __eot__ Sir, yes, sir! __eot__ The rest of you, fallout for physicals!
What the fuck is going on? __eot__ Your weapons, Sergeant.
He wouldn't kill anybody... __eot__ Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West -- __eot__ I hated West, Childs hated West, everyone with a goddamn brain hated West but that doesn't mean we killed him!
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades. __eot__ Why? __eot__ We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.
Jesus, what happened? __eot__ West... he's dead.
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close. __eot__ So did we. Why didn't you come?
So you killed him? __eot__ I...
Whose blood is that, Jay? __eot__ West's. Any kindling for afire?
What do you mean, West's? __eot__ I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
Where have you been, Jay? __eot__ Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place. It's gettin' bad out there --  Where's West?
Roberto, what the fuck? __eot__ We just want to check your pack -- __eot__ Why?
You know it's not like that -- __eot__ Do I?
Right? __eot__ Yeah...
You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray. __eot__ You hated West more than any of us. __eot__ Maybe, but that don't make me a killer -- __eot__ You're the only one missing a grenade. __eot__ Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper. Were you watching your pack on the ride in?
Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me. __eot__ If not you, then who? __eot__ Mueller. __eot__ Oh, come on -- __eot__ We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away -- __eot__ That's exactly what he says about you. __eot__ Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?
You hated West, Mueller loved him -- __eot__ Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it -- __eot__ Bullshit. __eot__ Look in my pack. __eot__ Why? __eot__ Just look. Little pocket.
Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me. __eot__ You're lying -- __eot__ Pull up my sleeve. Right arm.
Why... why didn't you tell me? __eot__ Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him. __eot__ You saw West, right? How was he killed? __eot__ Full clip to the body -- __eot__ From up close or far away? __eot__ His chest was hamburger -- __eot__ That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first... __eot__ They? __eot__ Mueller and Childs. One of them must've taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper...
I... I don't know... __eot__ What don't you know? __eot__ This is a lot of information to be getting... I have to think --
There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it -- __eot__ No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s -- __eot__ We wait and I'm a dead man. I got a black face, a criminal record, and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much I hated West -- my court martial will take six minutes. It's either me or them, Ray, and you gotta decide right now.
A test will no doubt link you to the killing -- __eot__ Put it down!
You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you? __eot__ Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.
That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer -- __eot__ Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here. __eot__ But not the only victim, right? __eot__ My, my, my, how did things turn so hostile so quickly? If I didn't know better, I'd say you two were out to get me.
My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual. __eot__ Senator Daddy must be thrilled. __eot__ He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that? __eot__ I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water. __eot__ The Sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled. My father interceded, so instead, West Sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that I was gay.
Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one. __eot__ You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth. __eot__ What happened to "degrees"? __eot__ I didn't kill him -- __eot__ Then who did?
Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was...  Enough to almost kill him. __eot__ But you didn't. __eot__ No. Poetic justice, though.
He admitted it. __eot__ Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
Why did he come back for you? __eot__ I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door. __eot__ Mr. Hardy?
Somebody emptied a full clip into him -- __eot__ Stop.
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar -- __eot__ How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten. __eot__ Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer. __eot__ My heart weeps.
Is it the truth? __eot__ There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life -- __eot__ So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun -- __eot__ Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door. __eot__ No. I said Dunbar. __eot__ Huh. You know, I really thought you said Nunez. I thought you said "Dunbar was gone," My fault, I gotta check the tape on that.  Oh, yeah we taped the last interview. This one too. Cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie.
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?" __eot__ Well? __eot__ Sorry to disappoint. I'm on painkillers for the injury -- they cloud the mind. You're right, it was Nunez. Any more questions?
Dunbar will testify that you were. __eot__ Then we'll leave it up to the courts -- His word against mine. What does his father do again? Steelworker?  Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice will be served. In any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. He's quite protective.
Something funny, Levi? __eot__ I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not -- __eot__ I didn't do anything --
Why? __eot__ Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
How do you know? __eot__ Because I was standing next to him.
Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him? __eot__ I didn't -- __eot__ But you can't prove it! You can't prove anything until we find the bodies!
You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them! __eot__ I don't know -- __eot__ Where are they! __eot__ Maybe -- __eot__ MAYBE WHAT -- __eot__ Maybe he...
How are you? __eot__ Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called -- __eot__ What kind of trouble are you in?
That bad? __eot__ Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way -- __eot__ Tell me what I can do.
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator. __eot__ And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
The official term for it is "Clusterfuck". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant... __eot__ It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.
A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country. __eot__ Well, he's a good soldier.
The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning. __eot__ And the problem is you only got three. __eot__ No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up. __eot__ I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one? __eot__ Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me? __eot__ The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop. __eot__ And I'm the closest thing to it, right?
Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished -- __eot__ I'm not gonna let that happen.
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him -- __eot__ He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez. __eot__ Who killed Pike? __eot__ Someone must have got a shot off. He wasn't exactly a moving target.
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing. __eot__ There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it. __eot__ Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime. __eot__ Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car -- __eot__ Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession. __eot__ From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty. __eot__ Nevertheless -- __eot__ Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough. __eot__ Not for me.
You mean not enough to save you. __eot__ JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.
Tom, where are you going -- __eot__ Home, I'm done. __eot__ What about the confession?
You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault -- __eot__ What the hell are you talking about -- __eot__ I'm talking about West! We had him, Bill, we were there. You're the fucking Base Commander, you knew what he did to Cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has --
What I said before -- __eot__ Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level? __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ Does Osborne agree?
It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter. __eot__ That's horseshit and you know it. __eot__ Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll carry it.
You think you could explain all this to me? __eot__ I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.
They're taking your command, aren't they? __eot__ The Senator...
I'm sorry, Bill. __eot__ Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world. __eot__ You're a good soldier, Bill. __eot__ I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you? __eot__ What are you talking about? __eot__ If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you. __eot__ You're drunk -- __eot__ I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this.
Stay where you are. __eot__ Or what? You've gone round the bend -- __eot__ West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too. __eot__ That's preposterous -- __eot__ Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall. __eot__ I wanted to see if he was okay -- __eot__ You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike. __eot__ I'm not even going to dignify that -- __eot__ No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it -- __eot__ You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you. __eot__ Not for long.
No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough. __eot__ You're crazy -- __eot__ You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen. __eot__ For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about -- __eot__ Get your hands away from the desk!
Hostile and uncooperative. __eot__ Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
Ah, Christ __eot__ You knew Sergeant West? __eot__ He was our Drill here. Man's older than sand.
I didn't mean that as a compliment. __eot__ Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army. __eot__ And you notice I'm not in the Army anymore.
Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place -- __eot__ You and the Colonel go back. __eot__ He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him. __eot__ You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres. __eot__ It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording -- __eot__ Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this. __eot__ Subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, Osborne?
Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys. __eot__ Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall -- __eot__ Levi? Who names their kid Levi -- __eot__ Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio. __eot__ Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone -- __eot__ Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar. __eot__ He's in interrogation? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Move him. __eot__ Why? __eot__ Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute? __eot__ Excuse me? __eot__ Is Dunbar cute? __eot__ That is the most unprofessional -- __eot__ Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight -- these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute?
Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got. __eot__ Good cop/bad cop? __eot__ Something like that.
I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you. __eot__ Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.
The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, you're a murderer -- __eot__ See, Ray, this is what we call "good cop, bad cop". She shouts, I stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established.
Baseball? __eot__ I believe somebody owes me ten dollars -- __eot__ You made me look like an idiot -- __eot__ Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now? __eot__ You're right. We should sit in silence. __eot__ We're in the middle of a murder case -- __eot__ Best time for banal chit-chat.
What is that? __eot__ Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.
Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up. __eot__ You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib. __eot__ Something like that. You? __eot__ I lost a bet.
You're kidding. __eot__ Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.
This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it? __eot__ The very same. __eot__ You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right? __eot__ I plan to grow on you. __eot__ You're off to a late start. __eot__ So noted.
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here. __eot__ Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar? __eot__ He's telling the truth, up to a point. __eot__ What point?
Something wrong? __eot__ Being back here. Gives me the willies. __eot__ Not the happiest of memories?
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves. __eot__ Got it.
That was kid gloves? __eot__ Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.
But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes -- __eot__ I lied. Wait for it...
"Too neat." How long have you been an investigator? __eot__ I don't think that has anything to do with -- __eot__ That means under a year. Let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me -- murder is basic. There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people -- it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat. Dunbar's our guy.
I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder. __eot__ Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed. __eot__ Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints? __eot__ I don't know.
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend -- __eot__ You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave -- __eot__ Watch me. __eot__ You said you owed Styles and now you're gonna turn your back on him?
West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried. __eot__ You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal -- __eot__ Phenomenal at taking bribes, right?
I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong -- __eot__ Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here -- __eot__ But you will.
Why do you care? __eot__ Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
I didn't shoot West... __eot__ What? __eot__ Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot West. West wasn't shot, Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body.
At least you and Kendall agree on that. __eot__ What happened next?
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike. __eot__ And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness. __eot__ Dunbar. __eot__ Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events. __eot__ They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent. __eot__ And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world. __eot__ So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story -- __eot__ Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin -- __eot__ Buttfucks the cabin? __eot__ And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending. __eot__ So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber? __eot__ That bugs you too? __eot__ Little bit. __eot__ Let's go talk to Bill...
We're fucked, I know -- __eot__ They got their stories straight. __eot__ What? __eot__ What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter. __eot__ Are you sure? __eot__ Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second? __eot__ Good idea.
That's a fantastic idea -- __eot__ See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
I pushed him too hard. __eot__ You couldn't have known -- __eot__ Yeah, I could've. Should've. __eot__ You wanted to get the truth. __eot__ No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy. __eot__ You mean the falsely accused?
You wanted to break him. __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ So did I.
So what now? __eot__ Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened. __eot__ Think it'll work? __eot__ Nah.
You know, you never told me why you left the army. __eot__ It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out. __eot__ For what? __eot__ That's gonna stay my secret.
We were close to something with Kendall. __eot__ Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I? __eot__ No. __eot__ Good, just making sure.
Four -- __eot__ Get in.
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down. __eot__ Right back where we started.
Hardy, what are you doing -- __eot__ Isn't this how your story goes?
We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you -- __eot__ Hardy, for Chrissakes -- __eot__ WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?
No bodies, no West... __eot__ No death certificates. No crime.
We need to talk -- __eot__ Seven.
What? __eot__ Seven guys. What was it you said? You were "just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said".
This isn't the time -- __eot__ This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine. __eot__ What if I don't want it? __eot__ Tough.
That's not true. __eot__ There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees. __eot__ You're a good man, Hardy. __eot__ Really. __eot__ Far as I'm concerned, whatever you did in the past can stay in the past.
West? __eot__ Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
Do I have a choice in this? __eot__ Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
What are you doing out here? __eot__ Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do? __eot__ Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened. __eot__ Think it'll work? __eot__ Nah. __eot__ Want company?
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them. __eot__ I should probably write that down. __eot__ Yeah.
Your phone number? __eot__ In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
He was your friend. __eot__ Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked -- __eot__ What are you talking about? __eot__ A gay Senator's son who let his Sarge get fragged on a training exercise? The press'll crucify you and your father. His career will be over and it'll be your fault. But we do this different and you come out a hero.
How? __eot__ Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along -- __eot__ I don't think I want to hear this -- __eot__ Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
Pike, please -- __eot__ Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --
Maybe we shouldn't go. __eot__ The faggot speaks. __eot__ You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller? __eot__ You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
We should tell him we're not going. __eot__ Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland.
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half -- __eot__ Poor fucker my ass... __eot__ You better watch it, faggot, I'm not sure you and Childs didn't do him --
Pike and I got separated -- __eot__ Yeah and he doesn't know when -- __eot__ I remember now, it was before the explosion -- __eot__ Oh, you remember now -- __eot__ I'm about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly --
I was freezing from the hurricane -- __eot__ So you took off your shirt? __eot__ To start a fire, goddammit!  What about him, huh? Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts, brought an extra one in his pack. Y'ever think of that? Go ahead, cut him loose! First chance he gets, he'll waste the rest of us, that's how they work --
We just want -- __eot__ What, "The Truth"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem.
He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own. __eot__ He wanted more than that.
He said what? __eot__ "You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day. __eot__ No one else heard it? __eot__ He whispered it in my ear.
Nunez was chasing Dunbar. __eot__ Because he'd shot Mueller. __eot__ But you didn't see it, right? __eot__ Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
Pike never confessed. __eot__ We've been making progress, I see.
Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop? __eot__ Fifty minutes. __eot__ Not much time to solve the crime. Tell me, detective, how did it feel taking blood money from Guissepe Torres? Did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it?
Pike never confessed. __eot__ No, but it got you interested, didn't it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.
Dunbar says you were. __eot__ Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail -- __eot__ You can't threaten me --
It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon -- __eot__ What?
It won't work -- __eot__ It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
Enjoy your flight to Washington -- __eot__ Wait -- __eot__ What.
Dunbar's telling the truth. __eot__ Wrong answer -- __eot__ We did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone.  It was because I threatened him.
Who, Levi -- __eot__ Childs.
I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished. __eot__ I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret -- __eot__ So you framed him. The same way Childs was going to frame Pike.
What happened with Nunez? __eot__ He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out? __eot__ Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
What the fuck happened to you -- __eot__ What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --
Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first -- __eot__ Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --
Thank God... __eot__ What the fuck are you doing?
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move -- __eot__ Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but -- __eot__ Where's your shirt, Mueller? __eot__ I used it to start the fire -- __eot__ Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here -- __eot__ We're not going anywhere.
Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West -- __eot__ The fuck are you talking about -- __eot__ You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard -- __eot__ Bullshit -- __eot__ Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body -- __eot__ Shut up!
Tell him to shut up -- __eot__ -- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --
Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night? __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ Terrible tragedy. One of those Section Eight boys worked in here. Pike. Heard he got out okay.
Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning. __eot__ No, no that was Cadet Dunbar -- __eot__ You mean Ray Dunbar? Well, that ain't right.
So? __eot__ Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
This is totally unnecessary -- __eot__ He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman. __eot__ But this guy you called, he's not even Army -- __eot__ He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack. __eot__ He's not Army, it's not official -- __eot__ Then it's unofficial.
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time... __eot__ I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --
You think he did it? __eot__ No --
What do you think? __eot__ It's too neat.
You want Kendall, don't you? __eot__ He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore. __eot__ We know. __eot__ I'm giving you a chance to walk away.
What happens to Dunbar now? __eot__ Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
You never told me why you got kicked out of... __eot__ The army kicked you out for drugs...
You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir! __eot__ Sir, yes, sir! __eot__ Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir! __eot__ Sir, yes, sir! __eot__ In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir! __eot__ Sir, yes, sir! __eot__ So forget what you've seen on Sixty fucking Minutes about the kinder, gentler military -- you will either succeed, quit, or die by my hand!
Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me? __eot__ Sir, yes, sir! __eot__ LZ is two clicks North of a cabin, you are to split into teams of two and work your way through your designated area blasting as many targets as you can find! Each area has twenty targets, first team to take all twenty and find the cabin wins! Teams are as follows -- Dunbar and Nunez, Pike and Mueller, Kendall and Childs!
Great, great. That's fantastic. __eot__ It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star. __eot__ That's great.
See! The big guy likes it. __eot__ I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her. __eot__ Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives. __eot__ I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone. __eot__ Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat? __eot__ Yes! __eot__ I know her uncle. Friends of the family. __eot__ Who is she? Where does she live? __eot__ Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
What do you mean? You don't even know me. __eot__ Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back. __eot__ I've got a whole backpack full of clothes!
Someone stole my backpack. __eot__ Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning. Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there.
I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet. __eot__ Sorry, kid. I don't do charity. __eot__ I'll work night and day, and you won't have to pay me. You just have to tell me who she is.
Didn't kill anything, did I? __eot__ A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead. __eot__ That would explain the indigestion.
I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl. __eot__ There's only one I want.
Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry. __eot__ Thank you. __eot__ Good luck, kid.
Welcome to ya. What's your name? __eot__ Edward Bloom.
Bloom like a flower? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We weren't expecting you yet.
You were expecting me? __eot__ Not yet.
What is this place? __eot__ The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow. __eot__ The poet? What ever happened to him? __eot__ He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you. __eot__ No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm already running late.
Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate. __eot__ It truly is.
I have to leave. Tonight. __eot__ Why? __eot__ This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere. __eot__ No one's ever left.
You won't find a better place! __eot__ I don't expect to.
Or are you too scared? __eot__ I'll go in right now and get that eye. __eot__ Then do it. __eot__ Fine, I will. __eot__ Fine, you do it. __eot__ Fine, I'm doing it.
You get the eye? __eot__ I brought it. __eot__ Let's see it.
Bloom! __eot__ Don. __eot__ What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine! __eot__ I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
Will. __eot__ Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine. __eot__ A pleasure.
Can I see him? __eot__ Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them. __eot__ My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
How long have you known my father? __eot__ Thirty years. Maybe more. __eot__ How would you describe him? __eot__ Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born? __eot__ A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish. __eot__ Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that? __eot__ No. __eot__ Your mother came in about three in the afternoon. Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in Wichita. You were born a week early, but there were no complications. It was a perfect delivery. Now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it wasn't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so I can't see as it would have been much different had he been there. And that's the real story of how you were born.
Did you see that woman? __eot__ What did she look like? __eot__ Well, she... uh... __eot__ Was she nekkid?
Yeah. __eot__ It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.
How old are you? __eot__ Eighteen. __eot__ I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38. __eot__ You're pretty good at arithmetic. __eot__ And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And that's not much difference at all.
How are you gonna make it without your shoes? __eot__ I suspect it will hurt a lot.
Promise me you'll come back. __eot__ I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
You must be Edward Bloom. __eot__ How did you know?
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town. __eot__ Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety. __eot__ So I've heard. __eot__ I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
In so many words, yes. __eot__ Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time. __eot__ It's not like you're going to lose anything. You can ask anyone in town. I've been nothing if not generous. I want the best for everyone.
Helping people makes me happy. __eot__ I'm not convinced you should be happy. __eot__ I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married. __eot__ I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom. __eot__ I see. I thank you for your time.
It's okay, just leave it. __eot__ I can get it. I can just...
Lord, I'm sorry I... __eot__ Please. Go. Just go. __eot__ I'll... __eot__ Go.
Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife. __eot__ I know. __eot__ And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one. __eot__ Lucky girl. __eot__ I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.
Really. __eot__ You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
Hi. How are you feeling? __eot__ I was dreaming. __eot__ What were you dreaming about?
Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, "Your Aunt is going to die." I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead. __eot__ That's terrible. __eot__ Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power. Wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, "Your Grampa is going to die." Well, I ran right back to my parents. My father said, no, Gramps is fine, but I could see there was trepidation. And true enough, that next morning my Grampa was dead.
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman. __eot__ No, I understand. __eot__ He was slipping her a little extra cream.
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box. __eot__ Stop. __eot__ They were squeezing the cheese. Clanking the bottles. Licking the popsicle.
Spooning the sherbet. __eot__ Can I take your picture? __eot__ You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary. __eot__ Please?
That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else. __eot__ I never knew. __eot__ Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor. __eot__ Oh, so this is a tall tale? __eot__ Well, it's not a short one.
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding. __eot__ Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty? __eot__ Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
There was one time when I was eleven... __eot__ You were talking about your wedding. __eot__ I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either. __eot__ I like your stories. __eot__ And I like you.
Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em. __eot__ Really? __eot__ Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you? __eot__ I can. __eot__ So why are you wasting your time in a small town? You're a big man. You should be in the big city.
You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here. __eot__ What's your name, Giant? __eot__ Karl. __eot__ Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer. __eot__ You don't like it? __eot__ I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?
Okay. __eot__ Okay.
What did she say? __eot__ Beats me.
You know anyone's who's taken it? __eot__ That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.
You're not trying to run away? __eot__ Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish. __eot__ Make him stop.
What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son? __eot__ I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born. __eot__ Jesus Christ. __eot__ Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind? __eot__ Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story. __eot__ No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
The one about the witch. __eot__ Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares. __eot__ I'm not scared.
You --  -- are in for a surprise. __eot__ Am I? __eot__ Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings... __eot__ Did you do any of that? __eot__ No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine. __eot__ You think I'm up for it? __eot__ You learned from the best.
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go. __eot__ Really. __eot__ Truly. I saw it in The Eye. __eot__ The Old Lady by the swamp. __eot__ She was a witch. __eot__ No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic. __eot__ I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens. __eot__ So how does it happen? __eot__ Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office. __eot__ Okay. __eot__ And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said? __eot__ What did he say? __eot__ You owe me three-fifty. __eot__ Really. __eot__ True story.
When did you ever work in an office? __eot__ There's a lot you don't know about me. __eot__ You're right.
Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here. __eot__ You mean, while I'm here. __eot__ I'd just like to know the true versions of things. Events. Stories. You.
Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could... __eot__ I will. __eot__ You know where the chemicals are? __eot__ I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.
I thought you weren't dying. __eot__ I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
Why not religion, Dad? __eot__ It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year. __eot__ Oh, so you know.
Did I ever tell you about how... __eot__ Yes.
The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it. __eot__ I think someone hasn't.
But the real story is how I got the car. You see... __eot__ Dad? __eot__ Son? __eot__ Can we talk?
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad? __eot__ Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth. __eot__ Dad! __eot__ What? __eot__ I'm trying to make a metaphor here. __eot__ Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..." __eot__ The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water. __eot__ What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin? __eot__ I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact. __eot__ I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories. __eot__ You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake. __eot__ You think I'm fake. __eot__ Only on the surface. But that's all I've ever seen.
Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me. __eot__ It would kill you, huh?
What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be? __eot__ Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once. __eot__ I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine.
The river. __eot__ The river?
Tell me how it happens. __eot__ How what happens? __eot__ How I go.
I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts. __eot__ Like this. __eot__ Okay. Okay.
Let's get out of here. __eot__ Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
Where are we headed? __eot__ You say... __eot__ The River!
It's unbelievable. __eot__ Story of my life.
You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens. __eot__ Yes. Exactly.
I'm sorry. __eot__ Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
Oh. __eot__ But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
Daffodils? __eot__ They're your favorite flower. __eot__ How did you get so many? __eot__ I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.
You don't even know me. __eot__ I have the rest of my life to find out.
How can I convince you to stop? __eot__ Go out with me.
I was drying out. __eot__ I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
Wait! I need those! __eot__ There is no softer ground than town.
I've been working on this poem for 12 years. __eot__ Really. __eot__ There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans.
This is why you don't show work in progress. __eot__ Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris? __eot__ I can't imagine any place better than here. __eot__ You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
It's me. Norther Winslow. __eot__ I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
I don't believe it! __eot__ I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto. __eot__ That's great, Norther. I'm happy for you. I can't believe I helped.
So what are you up to now? __eot__ I'm robbing this place.
This is it? The whole vault. __eot__ 'Fraid so. __eot__ Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
Oh. Oh. __eot__ Hello. __eot__ I wasn't expecting you.
Are you Jenny Hill? __eot__ I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
How did you know my father? __eot__ This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
Were you and my father having an affair? __eot__ Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour. __eot__ I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has. On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother. I just never had proof.
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie? __eot__ Because he's dying.
Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game. __eot__ My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young. __eot__ No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else. __eot__ You didn't become crazy. __eot__ Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
Thank you. I'll bet you need to -- __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Down the hall on the right. The door sticks. You have to really pull it.
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible. __eot__ We'll have to pick up a copy.
I'm going to get started on dishes. __eot__ I'll help you.
I'm going to check on him. __eot__ I need to lie down for a bit.
I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to... __eot__ I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
Do you like it, being pregnant? __eot__ I do. __eot__ I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but I loved every minute of it. I did. Eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone, but I felt like I always had a piece of him with me. A little part of his soul inside me. I could feel it. It was alive and kicking.
It's bad. __eot__ It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo. __eot__ You need to go. __eot__ Probably tonight.
I'm going with you. __eot__ You don't have to. __eot__ I'm going with you.
I talked with your father last night. __eot__ Did you?
You never told me how your parents met. __eot__ They met at Auburn. __eot__ What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that. __eot__ That's because most of it never happened. __eot__ But it's romantic.
Mmm. __eot__ Mmm, what? __eot__ Mmm, what. I know better than to argue romance with a French woman.
Do you love your father? __eot__ Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy. __eot__ Do you love him?
You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place. __eot__ But it's not true. __eot__ What is "true?" I've never heard my father say a single true thing.
Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy. __eot__ You're not. __eot__ I need you on my side. __eot__ I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
What happened? __eot__ Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett. __eot__ Is he going to be okay?
How did you get here? __eot__ We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really. __eot__ Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport. __eot__ We rented a car. __eot__ You didn't need to do that. You just didn't.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car? __eot__ He's up with your father.
How is he? __eot__ He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat. __eot__ How much time does he have left? __eot__ You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek. __eot__ Really! That's wonderful.
Mom, would you say you understand Dad? __eot__ Of course. __eot__ What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him. __eot__ Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
Would you say you understand Josephine? __eot__ Yes. But that's a different... __eot__ No it's not. It's exactly the same. Your father and I met, we dated, and we married -- we chose each other -- because we understood each other on some fundamental level. Just the same as you two.
Josephine and I have a lot in common. __eot__ Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that. __eot__ True. But I've known him my whole life, and I don't feel like I know him at all. Or ever will.
I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all. __eot__ But I understand you, Mom. I always have. __eot__ Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now.
Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important. __eot__ Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
Was she one of your teachers? __eot__ No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me. __eot__ Do you know who that is?
That really happened? __eot__ Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
Is he awake? __eot__ He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
Mom? __eot__ Yes?
Did you and Dad have any other property? __eot__ I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it. __eot__ So you never bought any land. __eot__ Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there. __eot__ I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight. __eot__ That's okay?
Mom, do you want some time with Dad? __eot__ Yes. Thank you.
You first. __eot__ Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me £150. __eot__ What for? __eot__ You know what for. __eot__ No I don't. __eot__ I got you those trousers from Paul Smith. __eot__ I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week. __eot__ Such as?
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid? __eot__ Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff __eot__ I paid for those guitar cases.
Yeah it was okay. __eot__ Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked. __eot__ The sets were good. __eot__ The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred. __eot__ There's over eighty thousand here.
It's enough isn't it? __eot__ What do you mean? __eot__ You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop. __eot__ Do you want to stop? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ We'll stop then.
What's this? __eot__ It's nothing. I burnt myself. __eot__ That's not a burn. __eot__ It is. I did it cooking.
Do you like it? __eot__ Yeah.
Say thank you. __eot__ Thank you.
What? __eot__ You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby? __eot__ Name it.
What? What are you doing? __eot__ What are you doing here?
What. You're what? You're with this creep now. __eot__ Leave him! __eot__ You have. You've actually fallen for this prick. __eot__ No I haven't.
This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression. __eot__ Ch... __eot__ To customers approaching the bank from the rear __eot__ Right. __eot__ You can see why it's sensitive? __eot__ Uh... Yes.
Hello. __eot__ I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide. __eot__ Right.
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we? __eot__ Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you? __eot__ You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates. __eot__ What are you doing here?
Sorry. You've lost me... __eot__ I'm asking what you're here for. __eot__ What?
What did he say? __eot__ He says he feels safe here.
I need to know who you are first please. __eot__ Oh.  We are Russian. __eot__ Yes. I know. __eot__ Good. __eot__ And... __eot__ And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.
Hold on. __eot__ Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins? __eot__ Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem. __eot__ Right. __eot__ We better watch him. He's crazy. __eot__ Right. __eot__ I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me.
No. __eot__ Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
So? __eot__ So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.
What was that? __eot__ I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you. __eot__ Yes it's okay. Thank you for the food.
So how long will you be in England? __eot__ Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth. __eot__ You must have a visa or something... __eot__ You're asking for my documents? __eot__ No, no...
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John! __eot__ Uh. Do you like England? __eot__ Classic!  Thank God. She says 'Yes!'
She says she has a secret to tell. __eot__ What?
When? __eot__ "I saw you waiting there, by the gate." __eot__ I... __eot__ "I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
Binoculars. __eot__ Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
What was that? __eot__ Oh nothing. __eot__ Tell me. __eot__ No. It is too judgmental. __eot__ Tell me what he said. __eot__ He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love. __eot__ No. It's not that. __eot__ Do you believe in love? __eot__ I suppose it's... I mean define your terms. __eot__ It's very strange. How many people are truly themselves with their love? It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. There are no Marches Against Heartache, no Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment. We look away. And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. The one thing we all share but don't say. Look John I will show you something.
How is bank? __eot__ Fine. I thought you were leaving today. __eot__ To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.
I understand. I'm so sorry __eot__ You can stay tonight. __eot__ I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone. __eot__ Good night.
Put the fucking kettle down. __eot__ John. __eot__ Put the fucking kettle down. Tell, Yuri, tell him put it down or I'm going to make him.
He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says. __eot__ What? What does he want?
What did he say? Tell me! __eot__ He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry. __eot__ What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ? __eot__ He wants money. __eot__ Tell him to put the kettle down and I'll give him money.
He wants a lot of money. __eot__ I'll give him money. Tell him to put the... __eot__ He wants the money from your bank. __eot__ I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there. __eot__ You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank. __eot__ I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.
Oh Jesus. __eot__ He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not. __eot__ Oh Jesus. Of course I can't.
Just leave her alone. __eot__ I'm so sorry. __eot__ Leave her alone.
Is that everything? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Right. Okay. Good.
It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it. __eot__ Yes. __eot__ I'm pretty nervous. Are you? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ I mean... "Ants." "I've got a problem with ants."
So. Is it different to how you imagined it? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined? __eot__ Yes.
And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you? __eot__ Yes.
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Good. Or should I speak slower? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Do you follow or should I speak slower? __eot__ Yes.
Uh... Are you a giraffe? __eot__ Yes.
Today is bath day. __eot__ Sorry?
I don't understand. __eot__ Happy bath day.
Syevodnya? __eot__ Syevodnya __eot__ Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.
"Frenzy". __eot__ Yes I know.
They go. John. They go. __eot__ What's wrong? __eot__ They go. __eot__ Of course. They go. Yes. Yes. __eot__ They go.
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber. __eot__ You don't understand anything. __eot__ I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously.
Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee. __eot__ It's makes it easier. Okay. __eot__ I don't want to know. __eot__ It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why. __eot__ That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy.
So what are you going to do? __eot__ I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison. __eot__ They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank. __eot__ Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me. __eot__ Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute. __eot__ Well as it turns out I did.
You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world. __eot__ No I don't. __eot__ In the world. __eot__ I know you just want to punish me -- __eot__ I do. I want to very badly. __eot__ So you're just going to be vindictive __eot__ In every sense. If at all possible. __eot__ You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already. __eot__ Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to you, I'd like to give it a bash.
Where's the restroom? __eot__ What? __eot__ I'm going to be sick. Where's the... __eot__ What? No you're not.. __eot__ I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick. __eot__ No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself. __eot__ Have you got your passport? __eot__ What? __eot__ Shut up. Have you got your passport? __eot__ Yes.
Give me some money. __eot__ I don't have any money.
What? __eot__ I said I don't have any.
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name... __eot__ I don't want to talk about him. __eot__ Fine. __eot__ It's none of your business. __eot__ Fine. Absolutely. Must be disappointing though. Must come as a hell of a shock.
So uh... __eot__ Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is. __eot__ Oh Jesus. __eot__ If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does. __eot__ Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks. __eot__ But, you know, so what?
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed. __eot__ He will come back. __eot__ Excuse me? __eot__ He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again. __eot__ Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too. __eot__ No. But you tend to tie them up.
I don't want to talk about it. __eot__ Why not? __eot__ Shut up. I'm not listening. __eot__ You don't want to talk about it. __eot__ No. __eot__ Okay we won't talk about it.
We'll pretend it never happened. __eot__ So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate? __eot__ I don't hate you. __eot__ Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money. __eot__ And? What are you saying? __eot__ And. It's wrong. __eot__ And who says what is wrong. __eot__ And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency. __eot__ What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly. __eot__ So. What then? You just detach sex from everything.. __eot__ Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina. __eot__ Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what? __eot__ Sometimes. __eot__ Sometimes which? __eot__ Sometimes neither. __eot__ Some... What does that mean? __eot__ There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John. __eot__ I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again. __eot__ Why? __eot__ Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die. __eot__ So now you hate all women? __eot__ I think it's my safest bet, don't you? __eot__ Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
What? __eot__ You... __eot__ I got what I paid for. __eot__ You didn't mind too much.
It wasn't what I wanted. __eot__ So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no? __eot__ You don't understand me. __eot__ You don't understand you either.
Excuse me? __eot__ Get out __eot__ You are throwing me out. __eot__ Get out.
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world. __eot__ You don't have to say anything __eot__ What? I... I wasn't saying... __eot__ Please, there's no... Oh. __eot__ I wasn't saying anything. __eot__ Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong. __eot__ Yeah. He's a smashing bloke. __eot__ The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans. __eot__ Thank Christ for that. __eot__ You are pretty naive if you think it is. __eot__ I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing. __eot__ I don't have nothing. __eot__ Well what have you got?
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl? __eot__ No. __eot__ Have you had any before? __eot__ No. __eot__ Are you scared? __eot__ Not really. Maybe a little.
What happened between you and the blonde? __eot__ What? __eot__ The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard. __eot__ It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes. __eot__ Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John? __eot__ She's dead.
I'm sorry. __eot__ I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
What? __eot__ I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry. __eot__ She's alive?
She's alive!! She is not dead? __eot__ Laugh it up.
You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog. __eot__ I'm trying to quit. __eot__ I've got news for you. It's not working. __eot__ I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy. __eot__ Nobody's that unhappy. __eot__ Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die? __eot__ I don't want anyone to die. __eot__ Except for Small Eyes. __eot__ Except for Small Eyes.
I don't know. __eot__ What was her name? __eot__ What's your name?
You know you can come under the blanket. __eot__ It's alright.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee? __eot__ No. I think I better just go. __eot__ Okay. Thank you. __eot__ Whatever.
Yeah. No thanks. __eot__ Please. Why not? __eot__ Because it was a lie.
Okay. Goodbye. __eot__ Goodbye.
Something else. __eot__ Okay. Promise?
You can probably buy them on the flight. __eot__ I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye. __eot__ Goodbye. __eot__ You didn't deserve me John Buckingham. __eot__ Whatever. __eot__ I'm sorry. __eot__ Please.
It's not mine. __eot__ It's not mine either. __eot__ It's what you came back for.
Why? __eot__ I'm not asking you to marry me. __eot__ No. What? No. I know. __eot__ It's more like a date. __eot__ It's a long way to go for a date. __eot__ Tell me about it.
What does it mean? __eot__ Maybe you will find out.
Hurry. I'll wait for you here. __eot__ Right.
My name's Sophia. __eot__ Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
Is the flight full? __eot__ I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed. __eot__ Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.
You have excellent English. __eot__ Thanks. __eot__ How do you want to pay? __eot__ Cash.
What are you doing? __eot__ Just wanted to see. __eot__ You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you? __eot__ Yeah, I know. __eot__ Then start taking them seriously. __eot__ Yes, ma'am.
Lazarus? __eot__ Oh! Gave me a start. __eot__ I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back. __eot__ You hurt it? __eot__ I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'. __eot__ Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays. __eot__ Well. It's good to see you.
Angela? __eot__ Yes? __eot__ I need to uh... __eot__ Go on, Laz. You can talk to me. __eot__ My little niece... she got this deep cough. __eot__ You take her to a doctor? __eot__ No. No, she can't go. Mean to say... they's just no money fo'a doctor. Her daddy left for a job, and uh... give her to me to look on. I just...  I don't know what to do.
Is your niece older than 12? __eot__ Oh, she older than that.
My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box. __eot__ This gonna get you in trouble? __eot__ Not if no one finds out.
Thank you.  Oh. My wife. She had a card here for her migraine pills. She ain't gonna be around no more... So if you... __eot__ I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business. __eot__ Don't make it less true.
I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans. __eot__ You didn't have to do this. __eot__ Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank. __eot__ Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
This was very sweet of you. __eot__ Well. Hope you enjoy it.
I bet you have loyal customers. __eot__ You liked what I brung ya? __eot__ Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo. __eot__ That'd be nice. __eot__ I put on the lotion you got me. Can you smell it?
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir. __eot__ At church? __eot__ Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so... __eot__ You gonna sing me somethin'? __eot__ When? Now? Oh. No. __eot__ Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy.
Hey. __eot__ Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over. __eot__ What do you need? __eot__ I need ya help again.
More cough syrup? __eot__ Can I come in?
I lied to you. It was wrong. But at the time... I didn't know what to do. Imagine you got an earful from folks about that gal I's carryin'... __eot__ Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me... __eot__ Yes, I do. Cuz I feel for you. Mean to say...  I got feelings for you. And I didn't want you to think... I didn't...  I don't want you to go away. There's better ways to say what I'm trying to say, but... they it is. Don't go away.
Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well I can get hurt like this. And I have been hurt. Just like you.  Woman like me, I got a lot of livin' to do. But my days are precious to me. They all I got left. Don't want no more fuss. I want love in my life. You understanding me, Laz? __eot__ I do. God's truth. I do.
He black alright, he just ain't blue. __eot__ Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now. __eot__ Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'. __eot__ You seen my snake-skin shoes?
Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow? __eot__ Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day. __eot__ Don't gotta tell me. Me and my girlfriends use-ta talk 'bout them hard fingertips he got pickin' that guitar.
Hi. __eot__ Hey. __eot__ You ain't the kicker, are you? __eot__ No, ma'am. __eot__ Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose. __eot__ Can I put it in your mouth? __eot__ Okay.
And, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for? __eot__ That young lady's size, right'cher. __eot__ Well, that makes it easier.
Mind I ask, what's all this business here? __eot__ These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion. __eot__ For your hands? __eot__ Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower. __eot__ I'll take a jar of that, too.
Still need a lift? __eot__ Yeah. Transmission's shot.
Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay. __eot__ You gonna miss your bus.
Holy shit. __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ Sit down, man. Need a beer? __eot__ Sure. __eot__ Marv, let's get Ronnie set up here.
What happened? __eot__ They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home. __eot__ I guess it could be worse. You could be comin' back in a body bag.
I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere. __eot__ She's around. Always is. __eot__ I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right? __eot__ You been home yet? __eot__ Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside. __eot__ You need a ride?
This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it. __eot__ She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off? __eot__ I just been so mixed up lately, Gill. And, you know, with her history, I can see how she could get scared...  ...and run.
Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school... __eot__ That's not right, really, cuz I... __eot__ You joined up in that monkey troop cuz you had a plan for yourself. Army'd pay for school. You were gonna get a degree, maybe somethin' in business or agriculture and you were gonna make somethin' of yourself.
And then you had to fall in love with the school slut. __eot__ Now wait... __eot__ With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go. __eot__ I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...
YOU HAD A PLAN! YOU HAD A GODDAMN LIFE! AND SHE JUST FUCKED THE GUTS OUT OF YOU! __eot__ It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her... __eot__ The only thing that cunt's had behind her is me and half the town fuckin' her.  Your first night away, I come over and drop off the spare keys like you wanted me to. You weren't gone two hours and she was aching to get me inside her. Like she was havin' some kind'a fit.
You gonna steal my truck? __eot__ Make yourself at home. You done it already.
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends. __eot__ You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you? __eot__ You go to hell.
Jes? Jesse?  Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP! __eot__ Stop what?
Thought you had a skirt earlier. __eot__ I got others.
This thing you got... I've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy. I can see that.  But that nigger Tehronne. Thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps. I mean, I can see a tree. But that piece of shit? __eot__ I begged him. Don't see why he had to go... __eot__ I bet you did. Just had to get that black cock up in you. I swear to God. What Ronnie sees... you disgust me.
The fuck you laughin' at? __eot__ You don't got half what Tehronne got.
Ronnie ship out this mornin'? __eot__ It's so stupid. Says to me that he don't want nothin' to do with no military career. Says he wants to move. Open up an auto shop with his uncle up in Knoxville. I said, okay. How about now? Let's go.
Nothing's gonna happen. Not like everybody over there is in the line of fire with them Arabs blowin' themselves up. __eot__ Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd. __eot__ Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married. __eot__ I begged him not to go. And he did.
You wanna go home? __eot__ It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good. __eot__ Here. Pound this and I'll join you.
Better? __eot__ Yeah.
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit. __eot__ Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?
We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company... __eot__ If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha. __eot__ Think this about money still, ya old fool? __eot__ Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear? __eot__ How many times we been over this, Laz? How many times?
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this. __eot__ Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that? __eot__ I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do. __eot__ And you gonna live it with him?
Rose. Folks get sick. But you do what you can to get on the mend. Our marriage... it just got sick. That's all. __eot__ Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house. __eot__ I keep the heat on. __eot__ That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed. __eot__ Kept us warm for twelve years.
I deserve better than this. __eot__ Better'n me? __eot__ Better than what you give. __eot__ Rose... please... __eot__ Laz... You can't say nothin'... __eot__ If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's... __eot__ I don't love ya no more.
God forgive you, for how you done me... __eot__ Let go... __eot__ My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me. __eot__ Let go of my arm... __eot__ Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me! __eot__ LAZ, I said let...! __eot__ You better pray, gal. You better pray... __eot__ Don't you lay a CURSE ON ME!
YOU SHUT UP! __eot__ Careful how you point that gun, boy. __eot__ Or what? OR WHAT? __eot__ Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody? __eot__ Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off. __eot__ You sayin' you'll do what? __eot__ You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill.. __eot__ BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
You testing me? Huh? You testin' me, old man? __eot__ Test. Shit. What kind'a test you thinkin'? You mean like, if you a man or not? If you a killer? Only one way to prove that. You just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back.
GODDAMMIT, RAE! __eot__ BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own. __eot__ SHUT UP! SHUT UP! __eot__ Put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. That's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. She'd fear ya then. Cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. She with a real man now. A real KILLER!
Don't... don't say that to me... __eot__ Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face!
Like a man. __eot__ Yes. I mean that's it. I wanna feel like a man with her. I wanna feel like the only man with her.
Teh... Tehronne? __eot__ Tehronne? Tehronne done this?
Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE! __eot__ GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
Mm-mm... Mm-mm... __eot__ Come on, gal...
Take it easy now. Don't rush it. __eot__ How long... how long I been out? __eot__ You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days. __eot__ Two days? __eot__ After your fever broke, you'd wake up in spells... long enough to get that medicine in ya.
Where's Ronnie? __eot__ Well I don't... __eot__ Wait. He left.
I don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all. __eot__ Don't need none. __eot__ Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more. __eot__ Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk. __eot__ Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way. __eot__ Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
Let me say somethin' first... __eot__ Why you got me chained? __eot__ Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right. __eot__ The fuck you been doin' to me? __eot__ I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road... __eot__ Get this Goddamn thing off me!
Now, no harm's come to you... and I aim to keep it that way. Ain't gonna... gonna run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. I'd be chasin' you all night. __eot__ Well I'm woke now... you can take this off.
Gal, you ain't right yet. __eot__ I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off... __eot__ How you let men treat ya like they do? __eot__ What? __eot__ These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that? __eot__ Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up? __eot__ You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks. __eot__ The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are? __eot__ I've saved ya life, gal. I can do and say whatever the fuck I want.
I give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. Get you to the kitchen. You need the bathroom, it'll reach. __eot__ What do you want? __eot__ We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it... __eot__ WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO! __eot__ God saw to it to put you in my path. And I aim to cure ya of your wickedness.
You some kind'a pervert? __eot__ No ma'am. __eot__ Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me... __eot__ In my house, you watch that lip... __eot__ Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE! __eot__ You sick. You got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.
LET ME GO! __eot__ You can holla y'self hoarse. Ain't gonna bend my will.  Right or wrong, you gonna mind me.  Gonna suffer you like Jesus say, to the FAITHLESS and the PERVERSE GENERATION.
Now you get up! And you get in my house! __eot__ Or what?
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS! __eot__ Whose doin' is that?
Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me... __eot__ You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness. __eot__ Hm-mm... Hm-mm... __eot__ I said... STOP! __eot__ I CAN'T!
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule? __eot__ Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong. __eot__ If I break one you gonna shoot me?
My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that? __eot__ Uh-uh.
Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit? __eot__ Itches. __eot__ Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story? __eot__ Uh-uh.
The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand. __eot__ I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'? __eot__ Gal... Matthew ain't doin' shit... this just a story...  Look it. I've seen it in nature, I've seen it in men. Ya got to change up your crop. Cuz that seed ain't gettin' in.  Ya gotta cut this shit out. Got no cause to be up under these fools, ruttin' on ya like you a bitch. Like you somebody's dog. No woman... who joins in union with Almighty God... or man... in the sanctity of marriage... should degrade herself... and bend to ANOTHER MAN'S WILL!
My God, gal, don't you got no SENSE? I ain't sayin' I ain't weak? Shit. Playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you!  I GOT SIN IN ME! I AIN'T GO'N LIE! BUT I GOT RESPECT! AND ALL YOU GOT IS BILE, GAL! __eot__ Let go of me... __eot__ GIVIN' UP THAT SWITCH LIKE A TRAMP! BEHIND MY BACK AND KILL MY BABY...!
Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble? __eot__ Uh-uh. __eot__ Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make? __eot__ I don't fuckin' cook. __eot__ Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you... __eot__ Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a... __eot__ If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water? __eot__ I can handle that. __eot__ Well, get to it.
They sure liked them devilled eggs. __eot__ You drink whiskey?
You take it straight? __eot__ Sure.
Want another? __eot__ We drinkin' buddies now? __eot__ To freedom.
Still makin' jokes? __eot__ No joke.
If you want... I can take you back to town now. __eot__ I ain't in a hurry.
Could you do somethin' for me? __eot__ Anything.
My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it. __eot__ I'm here with you. __eot__ I had love in my heart. And I gave it to one woman. And she gone now.  Where am I gonna put all this love?
Tell me what to do. __eot__ The... chain helps.
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out. __eot__ You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere. __eot__ He told me... get help. I just stood there and watched him... I watched him die, Laz. Oh God! GODDAMMIT!
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times. __eot__ No one's gonna hurt you no more. __eot__ You think God forgives people like that?  You think God forgives people like me?
Where you gonna be? __eot__ Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this? __eot__ I'm gonna just get some girl stuff, like make-up and... stuff.
You took care of your wife, like you do me? __eot__ I tried.
What is it? __eot__ Nothin'.
Get'chu at that table up yonder. __eot__ By myself? __eot__ You can handle it.
Are you drunk?  Keep drinkin' water and you won't get a headache in the mornin'. __eot__ Yeah, gal I been here before. __eot__ I guess you have.
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight? __eot__ Don't think that'd be wise. __eot__ I didn't mean it nothin' dirty. __eot__ I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
Sorry. __eot__ Looks like you know a song. __eot__ Don't know where I learn't it, but... it's there in my head.
How you feelin' today? __eot__ You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more. __eot__ I know that. __eot__ Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song. __eot__ Go'on and sing it, I'll play. __eot__ No, you do it. I can't sing. __eot__ Stop that foolishness. Just do as I say and close your eyes.  Close your eyes. And think about... well, for a song like this, I'd say you think about what you love. __eot__ What I love. __eot__ Get a good picture in your mind.
Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it? __eot__ I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow. __eot__ Well, this one's yours now. You ready to take care of it?
I don't want you to let go. __eot__ Maybe I won't.
Do you call it a game when only one man win each time? I think you call it a damn shame. __eot__ Word wit'cha. In private.
You need some weed? __eot__ Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like? __eot__ That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know? __eot__ Huh? __eot__ I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own. __eot__ This Rae... you get with her? __eot__ Shit. Who hasn't? __eot__ Why you say that? __eot__ She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do? __eot__ She like it rough? You like beatin' on her? __eot__ That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into... __eot__ Now, hold up. __eot__ See, that girl is in my favor. You heard me, nigga? You fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit. __eot__ You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was. __eot__ Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know. __eot__ What'chu sayin'? __eot__ She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
What'chu sayin'? __eot__ What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction. __eot__ What'chu sayin'? __eot__ What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
First hooked up with that bitch when she was 16. Girl was fuckin' the principal and two of her teachers. You know coach Reynolds? __eot__ Uh-huh. __eot__ He tapped that. __eot__ Naw! __eot__ Go ask him.
You ever seen a train run on a woman? __eot__ Nuh-uh. __eot__ Meanin' like a team of fellas go to work on her and she don't even break a sweat.  She into football, you know. You got a letter on your jacket you get that pussy in ya lap. I ain't playin'.
How a girl get like that? __eot__ Like I told you.
It got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. Got fresh 22's on her. Ain't my doin'. That's just how it came to me. Don't worry. Nobody gonna come lookin' for it. I got the pinks... got no problem.  Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus. __eot__ Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you. __eot__ Nobody ever asks me to do shit like this for people. And you know what? I'm good at it. Naw what I mean?
You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind. __eot__ I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her. __eot__ That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue. __eot__ I didn't start this, R.L.
Bojo called. Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle. __eot__ You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek? __eot__ I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face. __eot__ Don't know if God wanna see me. __eot__ He knows where ya at. Just answer the door if he come knockin'.
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off? __eot__ He's fine. Just had a bad fall. __eot__ Why's his britches round his knees? __eot__ R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place.
You get a call from Rose? __eot__ This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now. __eot__ Somethin' wrong with ya phone? Been callin' the last few days.
Goin' dove huntin'? __eot__ You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time. __eot__ You sayin' that gun's for me if I don't?
You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this. __eot__ Ain't gonna be moved? __eot__ Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say... __eot__ Or what? __eot__ I told you to TURN BACK!
Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND? __eot__ Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done. __eot__ A naked woman, chained in ya house? __eot__ I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home. __eot__ Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking? __eot__ I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this. __eot__ You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that? __eot__ Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby. __eot__ What's that chain around her for?
Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it. __eot__ THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT?
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come. __eot__ You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator? __eot__ You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit. __eot__ One thing at a time, Laz.
Pass them potatoes, Lincoln. __eot__ Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry. __eot__ This all looks wonderful.
Mm. MM. Now these eggs got some kick to it. What'chu got in this? __eot__ Ask the chef.
Gotta get that chain off her, Laz. Somethin' like this gets out, you could land in a heap of trouble. __eot__ I'm dealin' with what God put before me. __eot__ You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator? __eot__ Not like that. __eot__ Then what? __eot__ She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other.
The hell is this shit? __eot__ What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band... __eot__ The fuck are all these people doin' here? Been drinkin' in this shit hole for years ain't seen this many people since I don't know...
There you go, preacher man. Get me drunk so I don't stick my foot up yo ass. __eot__ I just know how you get. Good to know, them butterflies still in ya gut.
Heard about this morning. __eot__ We ain't here to talk about that shit.
Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door. __eot__ I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.  Who gives this girl in marriage? __eot__ I do.
You won't at the square this mornin'. __eot__ Get me ten bags of mulch. __eot__ Yes'sir.
Keep the change on that. __eot__ Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.  You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk. That's what she said.
What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is. __eot__ Why she got a chain on her? __eot__ That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy. __eot__ Please don't tell my daddy. __eot__ My mouth is shut, boy. And that's how we gonna keep it. Don't go braggin' to ya buddies, ya heard me?
So...  That your first time? __eot__ Yes'sir. __eot__ You struck some gold, didn't ya?
I skipped lunch. __eot__ Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.
Thank you. __eot__ I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this? __eot__ You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me. __eot__ So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  You think he's crazy for thinkin' that?
You a preacher? __eot__ That's right. __eot__ Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven. __eot__ You could put it that way. __eot__ But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse. __eot__ What's on your mind? __eot__ You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch. __eot__ I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.  I think folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that.
It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else. __eot__ Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.
This ain't gonna work. __eot__ Rae... __eot__ I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work. __eot__ Rae don't do this now... __eot__ It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid! __eot__ Rae!
Hey. __eot__ Hey. __eot__ You don't gotta get up but... I gotta go...
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay. __eot__ You feelin' sick? __eot__ I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get. __eot__ Yeah, I know.
I think it'd be better if you talk to me. __eot__ Yeah? __eot__ Just about anything, you know. It can be funny or... not. Just tell me somethin'.
Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick. __eot__ Are you wasted? __eot__ No. I just got a messed up stomach. __eot__ Holy shit! __eot__ What? __eot__ Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star. __eot__ I'm a what? __eot__ All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...
I feel better. Do you? __eot__ Yeah, I do.
Ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore? Gill told me. Told me how you and he... you and everybody... __eot__ Ronnie. Please, baby... __eot__ Did 'ya have fun with her? Sweet as a peach, I bet. Huh? Huh?
Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya! __eot__ Ronnie...
Didn't know you was workin' here now? __eot__ I just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests.  Your money ticket get shipped today?
What happened to your face? __eot__ Got in a little accident. __eot__ Yeah.
Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want. __eot__ You need money again? __eot__ No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got. __eot__ You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me. __eot__ Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know? __eot__ I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that? __eot__ I just wanted some make-up. __eot__ All that shit's on aisle 5.
I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all. __eot__ The hell are you talkin' about? __eot__ Now see? Don't do that. I'll go along with all you say about me. But that... you can't pretend no more on that. Cuz I was just a kid, Momma.  I didn't know about any of that stuff he was doin' to me.  And you let him do it. Some big nobody in your life... and you let him do as he wanted... with the only SOMEBODY you had.
I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout... __eot__ All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that. __eot__ But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew... __eot__ Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.
You got any money? __eot__ Thought you had a man for that. __eot__ I said we wasn't gonna talk about him. __eot__ What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me. __eot__ Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to. __eot__ What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now. __eot__ Stolen phone cards and two-ways is what you sayin'.
Mobile technology is the new fix for these niggaz, I'm tellin' you. I'm just lookin' ahead.  Anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough pills like they's Skittles. Hey, that's what you need, girl. Get you some cough medicine. What, you sick? __eot__ Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it. __eot__ Alright. How much you need, ho? __eot__ The hell you call me? __eot__ Eh, if the bootie fits...
I think she got to you, pappy. __eot__ You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.' __eot__ Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs.
... It's not like you were slow or anything... I think you did just fine.  I think you did great. __eot__ Thanks.
Hey, hey, where you goin'? __eot__ Home.
Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window -- __eot__ -- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos. __eot__ So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
What's this? __eot__ Let go...
Back-up. __eot__ Get rid of it. __eot__ Why? __eot__ It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat. __eot__ I'll get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater.
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello. __eot__ Charlie...
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's -- __eot__ -- I should tear your head off. __eot__ Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him -- __eot__ -- Hey, I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.
What are they doing now? __eot__ Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked. __eot__ Who do you think the Jap is? __eot__ Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know? __eot__ I don't blame you for being sore. It'll pass when we bag him.
Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me? __eot__ What?
Frank Abolofia. __eot__ The Wolf?
Some party. __eot__ Maybe we should do something? __eot__ Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm.
What are you doing? __eot__ Saving your life.
... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere. __eot__ I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas. __eot__ What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia. __eot__ Beats forty hours on a plane. __eot__ They say we got to turn around and come right back.  That's what they say.  I got a plan.
I call, right?  I say I got the dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits from some raw clam and we stretch it into three days.  You and I become a driving force on the local Geisha scene. __eot__ Not a prayer. __eot__ Hey, come on, big guy like you, cop from New York.  You're gonna be the biggest thing to hit town since Godzilla.
What'd you say? __eot__ Where is the subway station, please.
Nick... You up? __eot__ No.
Nick, have I been a good partner? __eot__ Number five with a bullet.
I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me. __eot__ Go to sleep, Charlie. __eot__ You didn't take, did you...?  You hear things.
I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie. __eot__ I didn't know. __eot__ The lieutenant was on the pad along with the rest of the squad.  I was new, didn't know shit.  When the feathers flew, I got called in front of the special prosecutor.  It's on the top of my personnel file.  They think I'm dirty or I cut a deal. Doesn't leave you with a lot of friends either way.
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun. __eot__ Hey, when in Rome -- __eot__ In Rome, I'll bow.
Let's go. __eot__ Nick, we can't just -- __eot__ I said let's go, Charlie.
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side. __eot__ Let's grab some food. __eot__ First decent idea you've had.
This should be it... __eot__ You said that in the last two places.
This the right place? __eot__ I hope not.
Getting very weird. __eot__ I'd feel better if we had some heat. __eot__ Maybe we should bail?
It's incredible.  Hit him or something. __eot__ I don't think he'd feel it.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him. __eot__ He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on. __eot__ Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket... __eot__ Nick, how we gonna bag this guy without any help?  Maybe I should work on that girl Joyce, she speaks the language.
Squid? __eot__ Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
Joyce can be nice. __eot__ What'd she say? __eot__ That I should let you pay for the drinks.  Kampai.
You cool, Ich? __eot__ Cool? __eot__ You all right?  You okay?
What does Ichiro mean, anyway? __eot__ What does Charlie mean? __eot__ Hey, all right.
Short shift? __eot__ Yeah... I came to save you.  If you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.
It's getting too cold even for me, Nick. __eot__ Connie... __eot__ All right, how's the new partner? __eot__ High spirits, desire, commitment. __eot__ You'll take care of that. __eot__ Give me a break, would you? __eot__ If you give me one.
Are you expecting anyone? __eot__ I wasn't expecting you.
Where do we start looking for this guy? __eot__ Where would you look for the mafia?
Where're you going, Ichiro? __eot__ The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
"Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire."  To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis. __eot__ Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night. __eot__ No, this is the place for the young Yakuza. __eot__ That's what you said in the last three piss pots.
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire! __eot__ What's the problem here?
Nick! __eot__ Give us a break... __eot__ It's Ichiro.  Ich. __eot__ Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever. __eot__ I don't deserve Ohashi's respect. __eot__ Why the hell not? __eot__ I don't, that's all.
What happened? __eot__ They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.
It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of their's.  A tie, a pen. __eot__ Why weren't you at the platform? __eot__ I couldn't keep up.  My shame is complete.
You must leave? __eot__ Yeah... __eot__ I'll get him for you, Nick.
I've continued working on the case! __eot__ I can see that.
How'd you get this? __eot__ I stole them.
Know her? __eot__ We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to... __eot__ A snitch?
What's he saying? __eot__ He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days.  He might not even be in Tokyo. __eot__ Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night.
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.' __eot__ No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize! __eot__ Nick...
What'd I tell you? __eot__ There she is!
Did I say that? __eot__ You toler -- yes, tolerate me. __eot__ Are we getting married?
You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop it, okay? __eot__ Sure.
Nick... __eot__ If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous... __eot__ Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki -- __eot__ Ichiro -- __eot__ Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue -- __eot__ Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
Yakuza. __eot__ Good.  Very good...
She disappeared... shit! __eot__ You were too far behind.
You can't come in.  They don't want -- __eot__ Gaiijin. __eot__ I'll check it out.
If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend -- __eot__ You can trust me.
I'm not drunk... __eot__ We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto. __eot__ Nick -- __eot__ Shut-up.
... A Godfather.  His man was killed at the printing plant. __eot__ I want to yank Kobo. __eot__ Not without a small army, Nicklaus- san.
Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick. __eot__ San is an honorable title.
Nick! __eot__ A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.
Where does this Sugai live? __eot__ A resort city, Beppu. __eot__ I want to go talk to him. __eot__ What...?  Why? __eot__ Because he knows how to get to our man. __eot__ He'll never speak to a Gaiijin. __eot__ I'll be a nice Gaiijin.
It's very small. __eot__ Big enough. __eot__ It's illegal, Nick. __eot__ It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow? __eot__ Sugai's not going to be impressed with your gun, Nick.  No.  I won't put myself in danger for you anymore.
What's in the box? __eot__ For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you. __eot__ So I bring some cheese?
No... __eot__ Let's go.  Him first. __eot__ Nick, you can't do this. __eot__ It's done.  You don't have to come.
Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside. __eot__ No. __eot__ Not now, man, okay, not now.  Work with me.
Start it. __eot__ I can't...
Just one, compadre... Kampai. __eot__ Kampai.
You did great, Ichiro. __eot__ I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me. __eot__ I followed them.  An hour from the train station. __eot__ How many men? __eot__ I couldn't tell. __eot__ Joyce? __eot__ I don't know. __eot__ We need the plate to negotiate with.
Someone attacked him. __eot__ Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
Thank you.  You have one? __eot__ A wife.  She left. __eot__ I'm sorry. __eot__ Me too.
What's that for? __eot__ Luck.
You know, Nick, we can't lose. __eot__ Why's that? __eot__ Because we're the biggest things to hit this town since Godzilla.
You all right? __eot__ Yes... __eot__ Call for help.
Louder, pal, louder. __eot__ Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
Think we'll get him, Nick? __eot__ We can't lose. __eot__ How can you be so sure?
Don't give him any more. __eot__ He gets as much as he wants.
Ich said you left. __eot__ There was a change in plans.
Dead gaiijin's are big news. __eot__ Gaiijin? __eot__ An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you. __eot__ I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time. __eot__ I don't give tours.
You can count on the truth from people who don't like you. __eot__ You have a helluva way of asking for help. __eot__ You have a helluva way of answering.
Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs. __eot__ Maybe I'm a quicker learner. __eot__ I don't think so.
She ever pull down her shades? __eot__ Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.
Don't be an ass. __eot__ He's on duty. __eot__ I paid for that.
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying. __eot__ Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
I need your help, Joyce. __eot__ Where's Ich? __eot__ Unavailable.
I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood. __eot__ I need someone to translate for me. __eot__ My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in. __eot__ It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night. __eot__ And I'm supposed to care? __eot__ You could fake it.
You're wrong to sell Ich short. __eot__ He drinks. __eot__ He's got a reason.
Where's the wife? __eot__ You met her.
I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense.  I chant. __eot__ What do you chant? __eot__ 'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course. __eot__ Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train? __eot__ I don't remember saying yes. __eot__ I don't remember you saying no.
They want your autograph. __eot__ Who am I supposed to be? __eot__ This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson... __eot__ Tell them I'm not.
We're in? __eot__ The cheese...
You'll get Ich killed. __eot__ No one's keeping him here. __eot__ Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not. __eot__ Why would you care?
I still think you're a bastard. __eot__ What if I chant? __eot__ Wouldn't help.  Watch out for Ich.
Can't make you change your mind? __eot__ Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head. __eot__ Might be different in New York. __eot__ Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out. __eot__ I'd like that.
Keep the change. __eot__ I'm taking you back.
Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid. Ugly little lives... __eot__ Save it, I already took the tour. __eot__ You are a lucky man.  Where you come from a man can stand out.  It's expected.  Here a man is made to look a fool for standing out.
I like your friend, Joyce.  You're lucky. __eot__ Guess I'm on a roll. __eot__ She's such a long way home for you. __eot__ Time, I've got plenty of.
This is my stop. __eot__ I'm amused. __eot__ Don't be.
Sugai won't give it to me, you know that. __eot__ Then take it from him.
How big a package we talking about? __eot__ This by this... __eot__ Dope? __eot__ Not in that company. __eot__ The old man was a Japanese paper manufacturer.  Hotel room and rental car were full of it.
One guy do all the damage? __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ Thought you knew your way around dark alleys, detective.
Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested. __eot__ Why? __eot__ He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him. __eot__ What?
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight. __eot__ What...?  What if I say no? __eot__ Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country. __eot__ Why me? __eot__ They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.
It's not your job. __eot__ He was my partner. __eot__ They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner! __eot__ I planned on catching him, Captain. __eot__ How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane. __eot__ He killed a police officer. __eot__ Your plane's at nine a.m.  Be on it. That's orders.  Period.
... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds.  They'll be all over Abolofia's place.  Stick tight. You I.D. the other plate, he does real time. __eot__ Right.
You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer. __eot__ Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
I want a gun. __eot__ It is not allowed. __eot__ We're police officers. __eot__ You're foreigners. __eot__ Work with me.  I want your best detective.
Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this. __eot__ Do you know what this is?
Could you fill me in? __eot__ Why don't you ask your chief detective?
Because I want you to tell me. __eot__ The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here. __eot__ Can we skip the poetry, inspector?
What's this? __eot__ Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported. __eot__ While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch. __eot__ Look.
Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR! __eot__ Twenty-four hours, detective.
Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you. __eot__ For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here! __eot__ You had my help, detective. __eot__ If anything happens to her while I'm here -- __eot__ -- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them. __eot__ I have to get to Sugai. __eot__ Goodbye, officer.
Seven years work by the finest engraver.  Mass produced, sequentially numbered.  The best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin. __eot__ I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for -- __eot__ -- Kobo... I know.  He killed two of my partners.  One in New York, one at the printing plant.
I took Kobo from the street.  I gave him a home, a future... But my ways were too slow for him... I served seven years in prison for my boss when I was a young man.  Kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun.  He was supposed to take over this syndicate when I retired. __eot__ I want him. __eot__ He'll be dealt with.
Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us. __eot__ The families who control the casinos? __eot__ Yes.  Unlike our syndicates, your criminals don't understand the words 'honor' and 'duty'... We can't afford not to deal with them.
Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar. __eot__ The Feds would be onto you in a month. __eot__ Not with these bills.  And even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be?
Why tell me this? __eot__ The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me. __eot__ You trust me? __eot__ I'll pay you.
With these? __eot__ Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police. __eot__ If I say no? __eot__ You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it. __eot__ I don't have to.
Good. __eot__ He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You don't stand a chance.
That wasn't our deal. __eot__ You want him dead too. __eot__ After a court convicts him.  He belongs to me.
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along... __eot__ We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost. __eot__ You certainly have a nice place here. __eot__ Well stocked.
He knows what he's doing. __eot__ If he won't cooperate? __eot__ Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated.  We'll appreciate him and he'll cooperate.
I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary? __eot__ I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us. __eot__ Pris?
Let's go while there is still time. __eot__ Where? __eot__ Anywhere.
What's the point? __eot__ Not to be trapped. __eot__ You underestimate the trap, Mary.
One man.  He must be good. __eot__ Then go get him. __eot__ That wouldn't be very sporting.
The name is Batty.  Roy Batty. __eot__ Oh?
Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home. __eot__ Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner. __eot__ It's not an easy thing to meet your maker. __eot__ And what can he do for you? __eot__ Can the maker repair what he makes? __eot__ Would you like to be modified? __eot__ Had in mind something a little more radical. __eot__ What's the problem? __eot__ Death. __eot__ I'm afraid that's a little out of my...
I want more life, fucker. __eot__ Come here.
The facts of life.  I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established. __eot__ Why? __eot__ Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks. __eot__ What about E.M.S. recombination? __eot__ We've already tried it -- ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen -- it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table.
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells. __eot__ Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you. __eot__ But not to last. __eot__ Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are made to last -- as least they were. But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last.
Also you're too valuable to experiment with. __eot__ I am?
I've done some questionable things. __eot__ Also extraordinary things. __eot__ Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
I like a man who stays put.  An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you? __eot__ Well, no, not really.  There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor.
How about breakfast, I was just going to make some. __eot__ If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be... __eot__ Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to. __eot__ Well, actually
Why are you staring at us? __eot__ You're just all so... so different.
What, Sebastian? __eot__ You're androids.
What generation are you? __eot__ Nexus - 6.
Show me something? __eot__ Like what? __eot__ Like...
We have a lot in common. __eot__ You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there? __eot__ Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet. __eot__ Of course not. __eot__ You could help us. __eot__ I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league. __eot__ If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live.
What about your friend, the man who owns this building? __eot__ Dr. Tyrell?
He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then. __eot__ Tyrell could help us, Sebastian. __eot__ He could? __eot__ His company made us. __eot__ I'd be happy to mention it to him. __eot__ Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to. __eot__ No. __eot__ When do you deliver your project? __eot__ This afternoon.
You're our best and only friend. __eot__ Thank you.
Where are you going, Sebastian? __eot__ Just thought I'd... __eot__ No, you stay here with us.  Out last night together.
What's going on down there? __eot__ He's not ready yet. __eot__ When? __eot__ Tomorrow, he says.
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian. __eot__ Hello, glad to meet you.
Then we're stupid and we'll die. __eot__ Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
I think, therefore I am. __eot__ Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
I want to do it. __eot__ Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.
Six, huh? __eot__ Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field. __eot__ What was he after? __eot__ There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing.  Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees.  Guess he found himself one.
You got a machine on it yet? __eot__ We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city. __eot__ Where do we start?
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek. __eot__ What was the cover on the one that got Holden? __eot__ Industrial refuse. __eot__ Garbage man?
Yeah. __eot__ Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it. __eot__ I was just about to have my dinner. __eot__ If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  I got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  Good luck.
She was gonna get away. __eot__ Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!
I didn't like her. __eot__ You didn't like her!?
Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin. __eot__ Yeah.
Yeah. __eot__ This is Bryant.  Are you alone? __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ She's not with you? __eot__ Who.
Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia South. __eot__ Got it. __eot__ Okay, here it is.  Eldon Tyrell, his family and half his staff were just massacred.  The cat is about to get out of the bag.  Pressure is definitely on.  The Nexus program is terminated.  When you finish there, locate Nexus designated Rachael and retire.
If you don't, we will.  It has to be total, Deckard.  That's an order from as high as it comes.  Got it? __eot__ Yeah.  I got it. __eot__ Go.
It's gotta be right for my customer. __eot__ Your customer, eh?
Well, when do you get paid? __eot__ Soon as I finish the job. __eot__ When might that be? __eot__ Day after tomorrow. __eot__ Oh!  Day after tomorrow.
Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot. __eot__ This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.
You equipped for random questions? __eot__ Why, yes, of course. __eot__ You start. __eot__ The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me? __eot__ How do I stop one? __eot__ Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run, __eot__ Okay, but... __eot__ I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  A direct hit is a positive retirement.
Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy. __eot__ I know all that. __eot__ What about a summary then. __eot__ I think we're through for the night.
Yes? __eot__ Do you have something against science? __eot__ Not if it works. __eot__ And what in your estimation works? __eot__ The umbrella.
Four years.  Which would make her termination date... __eot__ Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge? __eot__ Longevity is classified.  No.
Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females. __eot__ Nexus designated Mary:  incept November 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position. __eot__ Next. __eot__ Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers. __eot__ Number three. __eot__ Nexus designated Zhora:  incept June 13th 2017, athletic conditioning, highly competitive, special abilities in the entertainment field.
I think I have no money. __eot__ It's okay.  Forget it. __eot__ But I would like to buy you drink. __eot__ I'll but you one.  What'll you have? __eot__ Vodka! __eot__ Shot of vodka, please. __eot__ Thank you very much. __eot__ My pleasure.
Prosit. __eot__ Prosit.
You want to see my friends? __eot__ Sorry, don't have the time. __eot__ No problem.
Those cockroaches? __eot__ Ya.
How long you had these guys? __eot__ Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
Prosit. __eot__ Prosit.
You like to kiss her goodbye. __eot__ No thanks.
I like you. __eot__ I like you too. __eot__ One more, eh? __eot__ I gotta piss.
How old am I? __eot__ I don't know.
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live? __eot__ Four years.
I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great.  How you like my new suit? __eot__ Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.
Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee. __eot__ Sorry. __eot__ Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing? __eot__ I'm doing okay. __eot__ From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh? __eot__ Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about. __eot__ Money? __eot__ No.  I got a problem. __eot__ Let's hear it. __eot__ I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.
What's that? __eot__ I'm taking a piss.
Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it. __eot__ These aren't just... __eot__ I know what they are, Deck -- Look, maybe they can pretend to feel, but far as the raw, hot emotions of the old heart -- no way.
Nerves of steel. __eot__ No rust? __eot__ I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time. __eot__ Meaning? __eot__ Meaning you don't run as fast as you used to.
During the road test... __eot__ Yeah? __eot__ Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me. __eot__ Huh huh. __eot__ Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy. __eot__ True.
But you haven't put in for emigration. __eot__ Nope. __eot__ You're going to be over the limit. __eot__ Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there. __eot__ What if you change your mind? __eot__ They'll change the limit before I change my mind. __eot__ You sure? __eot__ Never been more sure of anything in my life.
Why didn't you go? __eot__ Too old. __eot__ But if you could?
My job is here. __eot__ Me too.
Taffey Lewis? __eot__ Yes? __eot__ Can I come in?
I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures. __eot__ Of course.
You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for? __eot__ Do you recognize any of them?
This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but... __eot__ What did she want? __eot__ Who? __eot__ The girl that doesn't look like that girl. __eot__ Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night. __eot__ What night? __eot__ I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones. __eot__ What's suck night? __eot__ That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her. __eot__ You talking about the Opera House on the Main?
Book the good ones for where? __eot__ Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties. __eot__ What shows? __eot__ Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.
Yeah? __eot__ I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place. __eot__ I don't know nothing about it. __eot__ You haven't felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way?
How do you mean 'exploited'? __eot__ Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person? __eot__ Are you for real? __eot__ Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could. __eot__ What the fuck for? __eot__ For holes.
It that mother real? __eot__ Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake? __eot__ It's a good job. __eot__ You mean the snake.
The best. __eot__ Does it eat? __eot__ Come on.
Jeezus! __eot__ Sorry. __eot__ Hey!  Do your job but don't wreck mine, huh?
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body. __eot__ I bet I would. __eot__ Little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress.
Me. __eot__ And who do I go to about you?
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit. __eot__ A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem. __eot__ But because your department can't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large, it's a problem.  Correct, Mr. Deckard?
It's artificial? __eot__ Of course not.
Are you apprehensive? __eot__ Why should I be? __eot__ For the responsibility of your power.  Being a police bureaucrat, you've got more than your share.
I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police. __eot__ You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
I'd take him to the doctor. __eot__ You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist. __eot__ I'd kill it.
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl. __eot__ Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian? __eot__ You show the picture to your husband. He likes it and hangs it on the wall. The girl is lying on a bearskin rug.
You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion. __eot__ I'd never get an abortion. __eot__ Why not? __eot__ That would be murder, Mr. Deckard. __eot__ In your opinion. __eot__ It would be my child. __eot__ Sounds like you speaks from experience.
Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters. __eot__ Ugh.
Is there anything else? __eot__ I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help. __eot__ I've already got more help than I need. __eot__ I think you need more help than you've got.
There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it. __eot__ Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no. __eot__ Two of us might be more effective than one. __eot__ I work alone.
You use your equipment, don't you? __eot__ So? __eot__ So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me.
Do I make you nervous? __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ I'm sorry.
I can imagine. __eot__ Can you?  I couldn't.
They probably want to find out when they were made. __eot__ Right.
Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite. __eot__ What do you want me to do? __eot__ Sit.
You ever take a bath with a man before? __eot__ There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
I told you I'd come back. __eot__ You did? __eot__ You didn't hear me.  You were sleeping.
Who is this? __eot__ Me and my dad. __eot__ Where is he? __eot__ Dead. __eot__ Oh.
How come you're not on the job? __eot__ I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out. __eot__ How are you doing? __eot__ Not too good.
What do people do in the afternoon? __eot__ If they are smart, they take naps.
Do you dream? __eot__ Yeah.  Sometimes. __eot__ I wish I could.
Did you cry when your father died? __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ That's another thing I can't do.
Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that. __eot__ It wasn't very good last night, was it? __eot__ I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it. __eot__ What? __eot__ I don't know... I think I missed something. __eot__ Like? __eot__ I'm not sure.  Is there a secret?
When was the last time you cleaned this place? __eot__ Hmmm? __eot__ Have you ever cleaned your apartment? __eot__ Don't be fooled by appearances. __eot__ It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?
They could clean around the arrangement. __eot__ I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
But if I don't plug it in how can I... __eot__ Never mind the plug, just go through the motions. __eot__ But then how can you... __eot__ I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.
This feels stupid. __eot__ Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.
You're sick, Deckard. __eot__ I never felt better.
Have you ever known anybody a long time? __eot__ You mean a woman? __eot__ Uh-huh. __eot__ What's a long time? __eot__ Ten years. __eot__ Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long.
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder? __eot__ Because it's not. __eot__ Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered? __eot__ Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it. __eot__ Do you think I simulated what happened between us? __eot__ No, I don't.
Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone. __eot__ What difference will it make? __eot__ Just wait here.
You know what I think? __eot__ What? __eot__ That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.
Where the hell you been? __eot__ You know where I been.  I been on vacation. __eot__ Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is. __eot__ What's up? __eot__ Holden got hit.
Bad? __eot__ Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you. __eot__ I'll see you in a minute.
Thanks. __eot__ Black? __eot__ Please.
Is this to be an empathy test? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response?  Plus fluctuation of the pupil, plus involuntary dilation of the iris?
May I ask a personal question? __eot__ Go ahead. __eot__ Have you ever retired a human by mistake? __eot__ No. __eot__ But in your profession that is a risk. __eot__ Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof. __eot__ Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it? __eot__ One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject? __eot__ Sitting next to you.
Well? __eot__ If she is, the machine works. __eot__ The machine works.  She is.
How many questions did it take? __eot__ Thirteen.
She didn't know? __eot__ Memory implant.  She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning.  I think she was beginning to suspect.
How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard? __eot__ Five, maybe six.
And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground? __eot__ Discreetly. __eot__ All pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer, an Esper 231 -- I believe -- and a photo over-lay packet is being produced.
Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard. __eot__ Sorry.
We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard.  Concentrate. __eot__ How do you know I'm not? __eot__ You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading. __eot__ I'm tired of this. __eot__ Almost through.
I kinda get nervous when I take tests. __eot__ Don't move. __eot__ Sorry.
Already had I.Q. test this year -- but I don't think I never had a... __eot__ Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as you can.
You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a... __eot__ What one?
What? __eot__ What desert? __eot__ Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical. __eot__ But how come I'd be there? __eot__ Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you... __eot__ A tortoise.  What's that? __eot__ Know what a turtle is? __eot__ Of course. __eot__ Same thing. __eot__ I never seen a turtle.
But I understand what you mean. __eot__ You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping? __eot__ I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
How come you were in my truck? __eot__ I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
What's your name? __eot__ Pris. __eot__ Mine's J.F. Sebastian. __eot__ Hi.
You want to go home? __eot__ I don't have one. __eot__ Oh.
Where are your folks? __eot__ They left. __eot__ What about friends? __eot__ I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
We scared each other pretty good didn't we? __eot__ We sure did.
I'm hungry, J.F. __eot__ I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place? __eot__ I was hoping you'd say that.
Whatcha doin'? __eot__ You scared me.
You look... better. __eot__ Just better. __eot__ Beautiful. __eot__ Thanks.
And you live in this building all by yourself? __eot__ Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
Twenty. __eot__ What's your problem?
Methuselah Syndrome. __eot__ What's that? __eot__ My glands.  They grow old too fast. __eot__ Is that why you're still here? __eot__ Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.
Ah, you get hold of your friends? __eot__ As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow. __eot__ Good.
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much. __eot__ I keep a lot of provisions right here.
What makes you think so? __eot__ You're all so perfect.
Hi! __eot__ Yes? __eot__ I was wondering if you might help me. I...I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here.
Oh, now, that's a great one! __eot__ You like it? __eot__ Bravo! __eot__ Thank-Q!
This is my new friend... __eot__ I'm Adam Webber. __eot__ He's really funny!
We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers. __eot__ Really?
You're kidding! __eot__ No, I'm not! My mom taught me. __eot__ Your mom was a dancer? __eot__ She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance? __eot__ Sure.
I'm Nina Aron, Adam. __eot__ How do you do? __eot__ Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life. __eot__ Fallout shelter. There's a difference. __eot__ Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my associate -- Mr. Brown.
We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences. __eot__ Come where? __eot__ My office. __eot__ For how long? __eot__ Well, that depends... __eot__ I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
Let's go talk first, Adam. __eot__ Yes, ma'am.
The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill! __eot__ Young man, stop right there!
How do you do? __eot__ I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
But I do miss that green sport coat of yours. __eot__ Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just-- __eot__ How 'bout a drink at the bar?
Please excuse this interruption. __eot__ Oh, brother...
Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair? __eot__ What?! __eot__ I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well? __eot__ Shallow? I'm shallow?!
Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself. __eot__ Do ya?
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature. __eot__ It certainly is.  I agree with you completely. __eot__ Eve? I'm leaving.
Bon soir, mademoiselle! __eot__ Are you French? __eot__ No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business. __eot__ Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
Get out of here! __eot__ No, you get out of here.
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner. __eot__ Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
Where are we going? __eot__ We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college. __eot__ No, I'm lost. __eot__ You're lost? __eot__ Say,...did you just lose your job because of me? __eot__ Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead. __eot__ Dickhead? __eot__ A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.
What's wrong with you? __eot__ I just had a mental picture of... __eot__ Here, pick these up!
I came on a bus. __eot__ Why doesn't that surprise me? __eot__ I don't know. Why doesn't it?
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing. __eot__ Oh, that's nice. __eot__ Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay.  Right so far?
So far? __eot__ Yes, I'm right? __eot__ Right. __eot__ I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again? __eot__ Again. __eot__ Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn? __eot__ Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right! __eot__ See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?! __eot__ It was amazing. __eot__ Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on. __eot__ Do you own a car? __eot__ I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car. __eot__ If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun. __eot__ You don't? __eot__ Nope. __eot__ Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!
I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me! __eot__ Get away from me!!
Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel! __eot__ Rogers Hornsby?!? __eot__ He's all yours. I was holding him back.
Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars! __eot__ So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.
So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ And that's it? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ I don't have to take a physical in your space ship? __eot__ Heck, no!  What?! __eot__ Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal. Get in.
So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway? __eot__ It's Webber.  Adam Webber. __eot__ Mind if I change the station? Better traffic reports on AM.
Wait!  Wait! __eot__ What is it?! __eot__ It's Perry! __eot__ Perry? __eot__ Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back! __eot__ Okay, okay!  Take it easy!
How's that? __eot__ Oh, I could die... __eot__ Over this? __eot__ Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off! __eot__ You are one scary son-of-a-gun.
Hey, what are you doing?! __eot__ I know a short-cut.
Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!! __eot__ I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!
That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life. __eot__ Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase. __eot__ Right.
I am so glad to see you!!  I thought I'd never see you again! __eot__ Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it. __eot__ I can't, it's yours. __eot__ Take it. damn it! __eot__ Okay.
Why are you doing that? __eot__ I haven't brushed yet. __eot__ Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait. __eot__ Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy! __eot__ Can't you please just talk to me for one second? __eot__ Okay!  Damn!
Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend? __eot__ No. __eot__ Thank-Q! __eot__ Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above. __eot__ I think it's the eyes. __eot__ The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing? __eot__ Watching television in color. __eot__ Hey, no kidding?  In color? __eot__ Cross my heart and hope to die.
See, ya. __eot__ Why doesn't it never work out? __eot__ What? __eot__ Why does it never work out?  You and...men? __eot__ Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
...Okay. __eot__ It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is. __eot__ Why not go to work for me? __eot__ Doing what? __eot__ Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks. __eot__ Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help. __eot__ How long would you need me? __eot__ Two weeks. __eot__ What's the pay? __eot__ What's fair? __eot__ I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
You got it! Wait here while I change. __eot__ Sure.
Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper? __eot__ They like Dr. Pepper. __eot__ Who are these people? __eot__ My Mom and Dad. __eot__ Very funny, smart ass. __eot__ Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
Wait! Wait! __eot__ What?
Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!! __eot__ Sorry.
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning. __eot__ Hey, you know. I was thinking... __eot__ Night!
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry. __eot__ It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy. __eot__ I guess we'll need another locker. __eot__ No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card. __eot__ You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? - -  but, I'd just be lost without you.
Thank you. __eot__ And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh... __eot__ Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay? __eot__ Okay. __eot__ Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat.
There's something else I would like you to help me with. __eot__ Name it. __eot__ Well, this is going to sound a little crazy. __eot__ Oh, I'm sure it will! __eot__ Then forget it. __eot__ No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it? __eot__ This is for me. __eot__ Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife. __eot__ A wife? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ What for? __eot__ Because I want to get married. __eot__ Why?! __eot__ I don't want to be alone. __eot__ You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites! __eot__ Bites what? __eot__ The big one! __eot__ It does? __eot__ Sure. __eot__ I didn't know that. __eot__ Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad. __eot__ They're all divorced? __eot__ Everybody's divorced. __eot__ It didn't used to be that way. __eot__ I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for? __eot__ One who's not a mutant. __eot__ No dogs, huh? Okay. __eot__ And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena.
When do you need her by? __eot__ Two weeks. __eot__ Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time. __eot__ That's what I was afraid of.
Could we talk about that a little later? __eot__ Of course. __eot__ Thank you.
Get out! __eot__ The engine is still running.
Now, get out!! __eot__ Yes, ma'am! __eot__ Stop that ma'am crap! __eot__ Sorry!
You almost got us killed! __eot__ I told you I've never driven before! __eot__ Never drive again! __eot__ You said it would be easy! __eot__ I was wrong!! __eot__ Is this your house? __eot__ Yes! __eot__ I like it.
Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question? __eot__ He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it? __eot__ Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants. __eot__ What?!
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail. __eot__ Thank-Q! __eot__ I thought only hookers drank those things. __eot__ Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay? __eot__ Um-hum. __eot__ I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot? __eot__ Yes! __eot__ You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife! __eot__ Wow.
Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way. __eot__ Good for you.
Where's he gone? __eot__ He's gone to check your answers on his computer. __eot__ He has a computer? __eot__ Sure. __eot__ In the house? __eot__ No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there. __eot__ May I please be excused? __eot__ Uh...yeah.
All right. __eot__ So, what are you seeing?
The what? __eot__ Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
The guy with the underpants! __eot__ That's boring!
About clothing? __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ Whatever you two want. If you've got the time, I've got the wazoo.
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time? __eot__ It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!
He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way! __eot__ Okay!
Hey, Eve! __eot__ Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?" __eot__ Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that. __eot__ Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight? __eot__ I certainly do! __eot__ Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think? __eot__ No it's not! __eot__ Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean... __eot__ Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left! __eot__ Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something-- __eot__ Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend. __eot__ Well...yeah. Okay.
My goodness gracious!  This place is something! __eot__ Look unimpressed.
No!  Not crazy! __eot__ Do I look crazy? __eot__ Yes!
Quit showing off!  We're here on business! __eot__ Good-bye!
I thought I was here to meet women. __eot__ Not that one! __eot__ I like her. __eot__ And don't be so obvious!
What have you ordered? __eot__ It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told.
What about her? __eot__ No way. __eot__ Why?!  I think she's very attractive. __eot__ Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you? __eot__ Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you. __eot__ Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please! __eot__ How 'bout this one?
Okay. I like that. __eot__ Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it. __eot__ What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?
Really? __eot__ Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have.  Same with guys.  That's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals!
That's ridiculous. __eot__ Maybe. But that's how it works.
Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me. __eot__ Okay. All right.  And what do I say? __eot__ Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
What? __eot__ Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end. __eot__ Did you?
You wanted to see me! __eot__ You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?! __eot__ Why are you suddenly so mad at me? __eot__ Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself. __eot__ I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied. __eot__ You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?! __eot__ No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most-- __eot__ I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to! __eot__ All right. Let me tell you the whole thing. In 1962--
Adam?! __eot__ I'm sorry.
I don't blame you! __eot__ Eve, I'm sorry.
I'm leaving, too. __eot__ But, Eve, I would-- __eot__ And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit!  This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous!
Eve?! __eot__ Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!! __eot__ I'm really sorry! __eot__ What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!! __eot__ I know...and I'm really sorry. __eot__ Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck! __eot__ What? __eot__ Goodnight!
Eve, if you'll let me, I can -- __eot__ Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?! __eot__ I know first aid! __eot__ Well, you had better!!
There. __eot__ Thanks.
I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable. __eot__ Is that what you call it? __eot__ But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it? __eot__ Sing it to me. __eot__ "All at once am I--several stories high-- knowing I'm--on the street-- where you live."  It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves.
Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before? __eot__ No.
Uh-huh. Adam? __eot__ Yes, Eve? __eot__ I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab. __eot__ Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi? __eot__ Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first. __eot__ My pleasure. __eot__ It was at least as good as the sky. __eot__ Really?  Okay! __eot__ And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious! __eot__ Neat. Goodnight!
Hi, Eve! __eot__ Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise. __eot__ ...All right, Eve.  If you say so. __eot__ ...I do. __eot__ Could I please just go home?  I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.
No. __eot__ See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand? __eot__ We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work! __eot__ My mother's like that.
Is that a birthday cake?! __eot__ Yes, it is. __eot__ Gee-ma-nee!
Is this because of the radiation? __eot__ What? __eot__ Nothing.
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel. __eot__ Fill this out please. And I'll need a card. __eot__ A card? __eot__ Yes, sir. __eot__ Of course!
Are you all right? __eot__ Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?! __eot__ All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father! __eot__ Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!! __eot__ I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ I've got to go, now. __eot__ Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray. __eot__ That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it. __eot__ No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now. __eot__ How do I leave here? __eot__ The front door is open.  Will you be back? __eot__ I promise.
I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man... __eot__ Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.
This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or you can have an "investment."  These are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable. __eot__ They're pretty.  Can I have them? __eot__ Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam. __eot__ Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday. __eot__ You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?! __eot__ Tempus fugit! __eot__ En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roulÈ! __eot__ Gerade aus dann links! __eot__ Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren! __eot__ Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?! __eot__ You know, you have a wonderful sense of humor, son!  I must say, the acorn doesn't fall very far from the tree. By the way, it's time I gave you something. Come with me.
These are wonderful. __eot__ It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now. __eot__ What's baseball? __eot__ It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher. __eot__ Like a painting? __eot__ No, son. A pitcher. __eot__ Like one of Mom's? __eot__ Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat. __eot__ The nocturnal flying mammal? __eot__ No. Sit down.
No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there! __eot__ Why? __eot__ Because he's forced out at third! It's a force! __eot__ Then why go there? __eot__ Because he must!
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad! __eot__ Blow out the candles!
Oh, boy! A jacket! __eot__ Your mom made that all by herself. __eot__ No kidding!
Holy Cow! What the heck are these?! __eot__ Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better! __eot__ These are really swell! I mean swell!
Well, do we just go on up?! __eot__ No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.
Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French. __eot__ Shit is a French word?
C'est bon, Monsieur. __eot__ Merci!
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ... __eot__ Yes, father?! Yes? __eot__ ...the pipe tobacco. __eot__ Yes, sir.  Is that all?
Also...stay out of the "Adult Bookstore." __eot__ Adult Bookstore.  Why? __eot__ Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget. __eot__ I promise. Is that all? __eot__ One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you. __eot__ I'll try.
But, I don't understand. __eot__ And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why. __eot__ Well, in that case...of course, son.
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it? __eot__ It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here. __eot__ Uh-huh. __eot__ Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers. __eot__ You're sure? __eot__ Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over. __eot__ That's what everybody believes? __eot__ Yes, sir. It's true. __eot__ What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?" __eot__ Yes. That's kind of how it was. __eot__ Uh-huh.
My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!"  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?! __eot__ Uh, I think they have. __eot__ Hah!!! Those cagey rascals! Those sly dissemblers! Those, uh...  They've finally pulled the wool over everybody's eyes!
You have very nice ceilings. __eot__ I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings? __eot__ Not particularly. __eot__ Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi. __eot__ I love Lucy! __eot__ You nut!
It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there. __eot__ And it's called...? __eot__ Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic. __eot__ Really?  Since when?
Right on the button. __eot__ Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
That's right? __eot__ I've never met anyone like you in my life. __eot__ She's right?!
I've got goose-bumps all over me. __eot__ Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state? __eot__ 1959. __eot__ Who use to own it? __eot__ Russia. __eot__ When did we get it from them? __eot__ 1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course. __eot__ What's the capitol? __eot__ Juneau. __eot__ Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha! __eot__ Sorry, that's the largest city.
This must be very new. __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ It's so small. __eot__ What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker? __eot__ I don't think so. __eot__ You don't have a computer in your cabin? __eot__ No. __eot__ How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak? __eot__ Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America. __eot__ Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat! __eot__ That would knock my father out. __eot__ Yeah? __eot__ Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him. __eot__ He's a Windows guy then, huh? __eot__ Yes. He likes windows. __eot__ Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that? __eot__ ...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste. __eot__ True.
Not on him. __eot__ I'm not wearing his pants. __eot__ Why not? He has great pants. __eot__ I just don't want to. __eot__ Okay.
Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that? __eot__ No.
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new. __eot__ Almost all of them. __eot__ The recovery is very impressive. __eot__ The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months. __eot__ Amazing. I'm very impressed.
That's why little things mean so much to him. __eot__ I LOVE THIS!!
Why did you park way back there? __eot__ Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car. __eot__ Oh. I see.
What?! __eot__ Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool. __eot__ Okay. Thank you, my friends.
I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry. __eot__ No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!
Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties! __eot__ How 'bout we check with Eve first? __eot__ You bet! __eot__ So, did you buy a movie? __eot__ What? __eot__ A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore. __eot__ No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on. __eot__ I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses. __eot__ Does that work? __eot__ Yeah...Seems to.
Good-bye, Adam. __eot__ Goodbye.
Bye, Troy! __eot__ Bye, Adam! __eot__ And thanks for always being happy! __eot__ What?
You dial nine to get out. __eot__ Of what? __eot__ The hotel. __eot__ I see.  Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice.
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy. __eot__ My father is a genius. __eot__ No kiddin'. Well...good night. __eot__ Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home. __eot__ How old are you? __eot__ Thirty-five. __eot__ You don't look thirty-five. __eot__ How old do I look? __eot__ Twenty-five? Around there. __eot__ I guess living up here makes people look older. __eot__ Up here on the fifteenth floor? __eot__ Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight. __eot__ Goodnight.
What?  What is it?! __eot__ The sky!!! __eot__ The sky?  Where? __eot__ Up there!! __eot__ I don't see anything! __eot__ Just look!!
Help you? __eot__ Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
Come on. Frozen. How much are they? __eot__ Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box. __eot__ Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles! __eot__ You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
Sure. __eot__ Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me? __eot__ Gladly.
Whatcha looking at? __eot__ Oh, my holy stars! A Negro! __eot__ Say what?! __eot__ How do you do, ma'am. __eot__ I do alright. __eot__ Good!
Hello. __eot__ Hi.
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season? __eot__ I was thinking of selling all the cards. __eot__ Really? No kidding?
See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that. __eot__ I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box. __eot__ Oh, that would be wonderful! __eot__ Well, we're here to help!
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again. __eot__ Oh, you got a problem with that?
I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry. __eot__ Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?
Oh. A nice one, I hope. __eot__ Yes, ma'am.
Elbows, Son. __eot__ Sorry, Mom! __eot__ You never know. You may someday dine at the White House with the president.
Dad! __eot__ Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him. __eot__ I'll go up.
I'm afraid you've got to. __eot__ I'll be all right. __eot__ You're my brave boy.
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing. __eot__ Yes, ma'am.
Right. __eot__ I just hope this is still good up there. __eot__ Mom?
Yes? __eot__ I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer. __eot__ Yes, ma'am.
Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything. __eot__ Yes, ma'am. __eot__ Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do. __eot__ Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry. __eot__ Are you in trouble, son?! __eot__ I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist. __eot__ A psychiatrist?!
Mom?  Eve and I have to go. __eot__ What? __eot__ I can't explain it now.  But I want you to set the locks for two months. You have more than enough of everything.  Then we'll be back to get you.
We have to go. __eot__ No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
This is your bedroom? __eot__ No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office. __eot__ Well, where are you -- __eot__ Eve and I...eloped.  We're married. __eot__ No. __eot__ Yes.
Oh, my God! __eot__ He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance. __eot__ No!  Not the police!  Don't call them! __eot__ I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser-- __eot__ No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs-- __eot__ Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious. __eot__ You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone. __eot__ And now you must let me be the judge of that! __eot__ I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is... __eot__ Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase. __eot__ Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit. __eot__ Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess. __eot__ What about relatives? __eot__ All back East. __eot__ The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper. __eot__ He drank it hot? __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ Good god. __eot__ Yeah.
You got a light, honey? __eot__ What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light! __eot__ Good.
So...you...survived the blast, did you? __eot__ The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!" __eot__ Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here? __eot__ "Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere. __eot__ Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?" __eot__ Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be! __eot__ Really? __eot__ Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture. __eot__ No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to go!  I have to...
For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests! __eot__ Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat. __eot__ Well, put it down and come in! __eot__ You bet, hon!
I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance! __eot__ We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?
It's time. __eot__ Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--
It shuts off automatically. __eot__ Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever. __eot__ No.  They all do. __eot__ I never know anymore.
You hear that?! __eot__ Yes.
Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates. __eot__ I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning. __eot__ Cheese is particularly troublesome. __eot__ Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip? __eot__ Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that? __eot__ Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
How long will we have to stay down here? __eot__ I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days. __eot__ Days?? __eot__ Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto! __eot__ But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time. __eot__ I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to. __eot__ Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers. __eot__ Yes, dear! __eot__ As long as we've got that straight.
Home sweet home! __eot__ To you maybe.
What's that noise? __eot__ The locks. __eot__ The locks? __eot__ To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years. __eot__ Thirty -five years! __eot__ Then after that it's safe. __eot__ It's safe.
To go up. __eot__ To go up.
Hi, honey! Feeling better? __eot__ No. __eot__ We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child. __eot__ All our friends...
Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut. __eot__ I'm not hungry. __eot__ Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite! __eot__ No, Calvin, you're favorite. __eot__ Really?
Maybe I've just got the creeps. __eot__ How could you?! This is just like home!
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me! __eot__ Would you like a tranquilizer? __eot__ You have tranquilizers? __eot__ I told you! I've got everything!
Oh, no. __eot__ What? __eot__ Uh, oh. Now it's time. __eot__ Honey?
Is there a problem? __eot__ No, Calvin.  Babies cry. __eot__ I've noticed. __eot__ What shall we call him?
No.  I think it's just right. __eot__ And I was wondering...if...if I could have a... __eot__ Yes! __eot__ If I...you know... __eot__ What? Whatever you want, Helen!
Calvin?! __eot__ Right here! __eot__ We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here? __eot__ Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway. __eot__ Why? __eot__ No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator! __eot__ Very nice. Unless it caved in, too. __eot__ Yes.  Well... yes.
Watch this! __eot__ What?
Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is! __eot__ Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school. __eot__ Nonsense. People have no idea what the human mind is capable of. Look at us!
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be. __eot__ Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept. __eot__ I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches.
Hi, honey! __eot__ Hi.
Calvin! __eot__ Coming!
Get the presents and do the lights. __eot__ You bet.
No kidding.  Who else would have done it? __eot__ And I made these!
What did you wish for, Adam? __eot__ If he tells, it won't come true! __eot__ Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family! __eot__ Well, we did in my family!
One who doesn't glow in the dark. __eot__ Calvin Webber! What a thing to say! __eot__ Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.
Let's eat our cake. __eot__ Yeah. Let's dig in!
If we still have one. __eot__ Yes... __eot__ You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon? __eot__ Would you excuse me? __eot__ Sure.
In the generator room again? __eot__ Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work. __eot__ I know exactly what you mean!  Hey, honey?
Should we say a little prayer first? __eot__ Just open the door.
Yes, yes it is! __eot__ It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good". __eot__ Yes! That's right!
I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants. __eot__ Mutants?! __eot__ It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now!
Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously. __eot__ No. __eot__ Yes. __eot__ I don't believe it!
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't. __eot__ Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now? __eot__ We stay down here. __eot__ We do? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Excuse me.
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything! __eot__ We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then-- __eot__ No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible! __eot__ Well, I am the head of this household-- __eot__ I want him to at least see the sky! __eot__ --and we will-- __eot__ And the ocean!  A mountain range! __eot__ --do as I say!
He's smart. __eot__ Yes, dear, I know.
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen. __eot__ Amen.
How long will you set it for this time? __eot__ I thought ten years. __eot__ Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and... __eot__ To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um... __eot__ Some time. __eot__ What can I offer you, Eve?
What are you bitching about now? __eot__ What are you doing here? __eot__ I forgot some of my stuff. __eot__ Your stuff?  Let me see that.
You came back for these? __eot__ Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow? __eot__ This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff.
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be. __eot__ Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
So where is your roommate, the model? __eot__ You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long, Eve.
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel. __eot__ Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
Stop it, you two! __eot__ I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able! __eot__ I knew you'd like him. __eot__ Darlin', this is X-File stuff!  Think about it!  The guy's got all this easily negotiable property. He's obviously setting something up very big.  Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America, for instance. Or perhaps he's the head of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard worse.
So, Adam...where on earth are you from? __eot__ Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs. __eot__ Oh, yes. __eot__ I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?
Give me your hand. __eot__ Oh, my God...
But first, you have to start with the clothes! __eot__ Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
I don't know. __eot__ Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
You're serious, aren't you? __eot__ What's that supposed to mean? __eot__ It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men. __eot__ Well, that's blunt! __eot__ I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits. __eot__ And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you? __eot__ I see "elegant." __eot__ Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren? __eot__ That's what I'm sensing.
Alright, I will. __eot__ I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins. __eot__ What do you think, Adam?
Well, what do you think? __eot__ I think...it...works. __eot__ Let me show you the entire trousseau!
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block? __eot__ No.
That water's freezing! __eot__ He's from Alaska.
Just be yourself. __eot__ Always good advice. __eot__ For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?! __eot__ Eve?! __eot__ Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal. __eot__ Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
Um... Eve? __eot__ It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
Go to the bathroom. __eot__ Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
He go back to the hotel? __eot__ Uh..he might of.
What's that mean? __eot__ We did not leave together. __eot__ Who did he leave with?
What's it to you?! __eot__ I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he? __eot__ Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me. __eot__ Those sluts! __eot__ Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?
Where are you going? __eot__ To bed. __eot__ To bed? __eot__ Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy. __eot__ What?!  Now hold on!  Wait one damn minute!
In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days. __eot__ Yes, you do. __eot__ And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!! __eot__ Uh, yes, you do. __eot__ Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean! __eot__ Yes, you do! __eot__ Or have perfect table manners. __eot__ You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me? __eot__ What? __eot__ He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady! __eot__ Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is. __eot__ Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses... __eot__ Where did he get all that information? __eot__ From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo. __eot__ So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible. __eot__ He didn't leave with them. __eot__ Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that. __eot__ He left with Sophie. __eot__ What?!! __eot__ It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear. __eot__ Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please don't tell me that!!
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door? __eot__ You're goddamn right I am!
I don't think so. __eot__ Coward!
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?! __eot__ I know...I know. You did the right thing.
Oh, no! __eot__ What?!
Gay. __eot__ Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you? __eot__ Fallout shelter.
What do you want to do with it? __eot__ Give it back to him. __eot__ And if we can't find him? __eot__ We'll find him.
What's wrong? __eot__ I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn! __eot__ See these?  Found them in the box with the cards.  These are stock certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.
Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?! __eot__ Have him committed. __eot__ Yeah! That's thinking. __eot__ He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever? __eot__ I don't know. I like to think so. __eot__ Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?! __eot__ To get some frozen poultry. __eot__ Then what? __eot__ We came back to the house! __eot__ You didn't stop anywhere else?! __eot__ No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store. __eot__ What?! __eot__ An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley? __eot__ Come on.
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop? __eot__ None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards. __eot__ Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home. __eot__ Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.
Adam!! __eot__ Where?! __eot__ Stop!
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke! __eot__ You bet, Mom! Coming up!
I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore! __eot__ Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you? __eot__ Um...uh...
I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole! __eot__ Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh... __eot__ Buy it from me? __eot__ Yeah!  Yeah, that's it! __eot__ I'll give it to ya, no money down. The neighborhood has gone to hell anyway.
Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here. __eot__ Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency? __eot__ Stand by. One.
Wolf One -- say intentions. __eot__ I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject. __eot__ Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to the ocean?
Tower, say again!! __eot__ The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight. __eot__ I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting. __eot__ Roger, Wolf One.
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have. __eot__ You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight? __eot__ Yeah. How's Dad?
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness. __eot__ Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you? __eot__ No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on? __eot__ I'm not sick.
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house? __eot__ Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house. __eot__ Oh yeah? Have you seen any? __eot__ I've seen a few. __eot__ Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go. __eot__ Okay honey.
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it. __eot__ Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by. __eot__ Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
Frank. Come in. __eot__ Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer. __eot__ Fine. Welcome. Come sit down.
Suave. Goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer? __eot__ Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya? __eot__ Fine Frank. Fine. How are you? __eot__ Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke. __eot__ Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
To your health, Frank. __eot__ Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank. __eot__ If you like Frank. Here's to your fuck. Cheers.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone. __eot__ EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. Let Tits see her kid.
See you Tuesday, Frank. __eot__ Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
Are you Detective Williams? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store? __eot__ Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he? __eot__ He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear. __eot__ You did? A human ear? __eot__ Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you. __eot__ Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it? __eot__ Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did. __eot__ Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
Come into the study a minute. __eot__ Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't. __eot__ I understand. I'm just real curious like you said. __eot__ I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business. __eot__ It must be great. __eot__ And it's horrible too.  I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.
Jeffrey? __eot__ Yes? __eot__ If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.
These are beautiful. How's the case coming? __eot__ Okay. __eot__ Anything you can tell me? __eot__ The criminals are winning. __eot__ Is that why you say it's horrible? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ I guess you've seen some bad things. __eot__ Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you. __eot__ Why do you do it? __eot__ I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance. __eot__ Yeah. I get it.
What is this? What color is it? __eot__ Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
What color is it? __eot__ It's blue. Blue velvet.
Jeffrey! Come on in. __eot__ Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you. __eot__ Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift. __eot__ Yeah.
Okay? __eot__ Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son. __eot__ I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help. __eot__ Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved? __eot__ I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more. __eot__ Is Sandy part of this? __eot__ No, not at all. __eot__ Who knows you have these? __eot__ Only you and the photo lab. __eot__ You're all through with this now? __eot__ Yes sir. I sure am.
For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later. __eot__ Yes sir.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!! __eot__ Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey? __eot__ Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom. __eot__ We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place. __eot__ Does Dorothy know her husband is dead? __eot__ Not yet. __eot__ Oh my God. Is her son OK?
Yes? What is it? __eot__ Pest control, gotta do your apartment. __eot__ Oh God, that stuff stinks. __eot__ Nope, it's new stuff. No smell. __eot__ Oh yeah, that's good.
That oughta do it. __eot__ Yeah.
GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME? __eot__ Jeffrey. __eot__ Jeffrey. Jeffrey what? __eot__ Jeffrey nothing. __eot__ You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont? __eot__ I wanted to see you. __eot__ What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here? __eot__ Nobody. __eot__ Shit. You better tell me something. __eot__ I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it. __eot__ An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before. __eot__ I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you. __eot__ Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME. __eot__ I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed. __eot__ The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word. __eot__ You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what? __eot__ Well. __eot__ THEN WHAT? __eot__ Then you got undressed. __eot__ How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress? __eot__ Never before this. __eot__ How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you. __eot__ No. Come on. __eot__ NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you. __eot__ Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave. __eot__ No way.
What do you want from me? __eot__ I, I don't know. __eot__ What do you want?
Do you like that? __eot__ Yes.
Do you like talk like that? __eot__ No. __eot__ Lie down on the bed.
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want? __eot__ Nothing. Are you alright? __eot__ Sure I'm alright. __eot__ I'll go then.
Don? __eot__ No. __eot__ Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
Thank you. honey. __eot__ It's okay. It's okay.
Do you like the way I feel? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ See my breasts? See?
Yes. __eot__ See my nipples? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.
You can hit me, if you want to. __eot__ No, please. I won't.
Do you like me? __eot__ Yes, I like you. __eot__ You can be my special friend and come and put that in me.
I made it go down the toilet. __eot__ What?
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it? __eot__ Do you know? __eot__ No. __eot__ You don't? __eot__ No. What is happening? __eot__ Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you. __eot__ Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go. __eot__ Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you. __eot__ Then don't talk about killing. __eot__ Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die. __eot__ Don't say that. __eot__ It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now. __eot__ OK.
Hi, can I come in? __eot__ Yeah, hurry up though.
Why are you here. Whatiya want? __eot__ I, uh. __eot__ I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you. __eot__ That's not crazy. I like you too.
I liked being with you last night. __eot__ Same here.
Oh shit. __eot__ Frank? Can you stand up? __eot__ I'm alright. Go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet.
Nice guy. Who's he? __eot__ Who's it, you mean.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die. __eot__ There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it. __eot__ I can't. I can't. You think you know so much. __eot__ Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?
Look. __eot__ No. __eot__ Falling. __eot__ No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
Who is Don? __eot__ Don? Are you in with them? __eot__ No. But you're in very big trouble. __eot__ Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me? __eot__ I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK? __eot__ Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now. __eot__ No. I should go. __eot__ Please, please stay.
Come in. __eot__ Hello.
It used to make me laugh, but. __eot__ I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy. __eot__ Yes. Frank-- __eot__ Frank is coming? __eot__ No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me. __eot__ I sure don't hate you. __eot__ I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong. __eot__ That's good.
Do you like my body? __eot__ Sure I do.
What do you want to do? __eot__ I'm doing it. __eot__ Are you a bad boy? __eot__ Whatiya mean? __eot__ Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything. __eot__ What do you want? __eot__ I want you to hurt me. __eot__ No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police. __eot__ No police!!!  No police!!
You like to open me, don't you? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ What if I told Frank that you opened me?
That wouldn't be too good, would it? __eot__ Frank would open you. __eot__ Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone. __eot__ Does that scare you? __eot__ Shut up. __eot__ Beeeee careful. __eot__ Come on Dorothy. __eot__ What if Frank came over here and found us?
Look, snap out of it, will ya? __eot__ Kiss me.
Do you love me? __eot__ Do you love me? __eot__ I asked first. __eot__ Sometimes I think I do. __eot__ And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud! __eot__ Just get outta my bed.
I love you Don with all my heart. __eot__ No, it's not Don.
I didn't mean to hurt you. __eot__ Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease. __eot__ You what? __eot__ You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease. __eot__ There's no disease, I can tell you. __eot__ Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you? __eot__ I'm glad you do. __eot__ There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death. __eot__ Dorothy. No! __eot__ If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold. __eot__ You called me Jeffrey. __eot__ I did. Are you? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK. __eot__ No. Not really.  But also because I really want you to be alright.
I guess I should go. __eot__ I want you to stay with me. __eot__ I think I better go.
I'll call you. __eot__ Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat? __eot__ What? __eot__ I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that. __eot__ You look beautiful to me.
Oh no. __eot__ No.  Hi baby.
Yeah, it's me. __eot__ Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God.
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God. __eot__ It's okay. It's okay. __eot__ My secret lover.
They hurt his head. __eot__ Who, Dorothy? __eot__ Don. Help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
Hold me, Don. __eot__ Don? Where is he? __eot__ HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him! __eot__ I promise, Dorothy. I promise. __eot__ Hold me. I'M FALLING!
Frank gone? __eot__ Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back. __eot__ Bull. __eot__ Alright, suit yourself. __eot__ He's comin' back? What for? __eot__ 'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight. __eot__ Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs. __eot__ Oh he forced you, huh? __eot__ He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby. __eot__ No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said. __eot__ Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see, I'll get you.
Hello, baby. __eot__ Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head. __eot__ Hello, daddy. __eot__ My bourbon.
MOMMY! __eot__ Mommy's here. __eot__ Baby wants to fuck.
Who's this fuck? __eot__ He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking. __eot__ From the neighborhood?  Shut the fuck up.  You like telephones? Huh? You wanta go for a ride?
Where are we going, Frank? __eot__ Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too. __eot__ Frank? __eot__ You want to see him too, right? __eot__ Yes, but. __eot__ Then, shut up!
Look at these. What are these? __eot__ Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE? __eot__ Those are my breasts. __eot__ Can I feel 'em? __eot__ If you want to.
Frank, he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. Come on. He didn't mean it. __eot__ Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  Hey, pretty, pretty.
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband? __eot__ He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue. __eot__ You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens. __eot__ Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me? __eot__ We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch. __eot__ Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
Hello? __eot__ Speak to me Fucker.
No thanks. __eot__ No thanks. What does that mean? __eot__ I don't want to go. __eot__ Go where? __eot__ On a ride. __eot__ A ride? Hell, that's a good idea. Okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
Heineken. __eot__ FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!

Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. Straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker.

I mean, for good, Jeffrey. __eot__ For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term. __eot__ Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store. __eot__ Mom.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey? __eot__ This is it.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready. __eot__ Be right down.
What time are visiting hours? __eot__ I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning. __eot__ Well. Okay. __eot__ Jeffrey, when you see your father. __eot__ Yeah? __eot__ He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you. __eot__ What? __eot__ It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him. __eot__ Thanks a lot, Mom. __eot__ Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
I'm going out for awhile. __eot__ Do you want the car? __eot__ No, I'm just gonna walk around. __eot__ Alright.
Can I use the car tonight? __eot__ Of course, Jeffrey.
God, you scared me. __eot__ Is something wrong? What's happened to your face? __eot__ Nothing. I'm fine. __eot__ You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in? __eot__ Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent? __eot__ I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go. __eot__ Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee? __eot__ Alright.
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame. __eot__ Yeah, I know. __eot__ Would you like a piece of cake? __eot__ No. No thank you. __eot__ It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good. __eot__ Yeah. okay.
He comes over to study. __eot__ Yeah.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake. __eot__ Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey. __eot__ Say "goodnight" to Sandy.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee? __eot__ That sounds great! __eot__ Anyone else? Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes. __eot__ Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes? __eot__ Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. Just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.
Sandy?... Sandy, please. __eot__ I'll get a coat for her.
No. __eot__ Looks like you'd make a good runner. __eot__ Well. __eot__ I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.
No, you're right. __eot__ I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered. __eot__ Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much. __eot__ Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE! __eot__ Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Hi Dad. __eot__ Hey Jeff.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good. __eot__ Uh-uh. __eot__ Are you feeling okay? __eot__ Uh-uh.
Good to see you, son. __eot__ It's good to see you, Dad.
How ya doin' Dad? __eot__ Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better. __eot__ Good deal Dad.
Yeah, how did you know? __eot__ I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
Oh yeah? __eot__ You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office? __eot__ Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something. __eot__ Am I bothering you? __eot__ No. You're not bothering me. You a senior? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ How is Central these days? __eot__ Terrible boring. __eot__ What else is new? Right? __eot__ Yeah. What are you doing now? __eot__ I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital. __eot__ That's too bad. __eot__ What do you know about the ear? Anything? __eot__ Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? __eot__ Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything? __eot__ I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names. __eot__ Do you know who was brought in for questioning? __eot__ There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others. __eot__ Were all these people questioned this afternoon? __eot__ No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts. __eot__ The ear is from a missing person maybe? __eot__ Maybe so. __eot__ It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in? __eot__ Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her. __eot__ I guess you have to get back home soon? __eot__ Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching. __eot__ Where are they? __eot__ I don't know, you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.
Did they find out anything when they questioned her? __eot__ I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case. __eot__ Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything? __eot__ My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered. __eot__ You really do hear a lot, don't you? __eot__ Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home? __eot__ I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice. __eot__ Still, it must be kinda rough. __eot__ It's not bad, but it's bad enough. It's a lot worse for my father.  I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.
What happened to him? __eot__ I don't know. He moved away.
I've gotta go in. __eot__ Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
I guess I'll see you sometime. __eot__ I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world. __eot__ Yeah. Good bye.
You hungry or thirsty, or both? __eot__ I don't know. __eot__ I'd like to talk to you about something. __eot__ Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
I don't want to cause any trouble. __eot__ I'm here, aren't I? __eot__ I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon. __eot__ Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
Alright, now tell me. What is it? __eot__ There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe. __eot__ You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps. __eot__ Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan? __eot__ It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess. __eot__ Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later. __eot__ Now, how are you going to do that? __eot__ Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window. __eot__ What will I say when she comes to the door? __eot__ You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think? __eot__ I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous. __eot__ Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this. __eot__ You've got a point there.
Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright? __eot__ Alright. __eot__ Let's go.
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name? __eot__ Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy. __eot__ Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner. __eot__ Alright. Good luck, yourself.
Are you alright? __eot__ Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright? __eot__ Yes and no. Did you recognize him? __eot__ No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall. __eot__ I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh? __eot__ Yeah, if it opens the door. __eot__ Yeah.
So, what's next? __eot__ Pretty clever. Are you game for more? __eot__ I owe you, since I goofed up this one. __eot__ You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight? __eot__ Yes. I do. __eot__ Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.
You really want to do this, don't you? __eot__ I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do? __eot__ First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings. __eot__ I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7. __eot__ Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good? __eot__ Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock. __eot__ Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
What's the plan. __eot__ First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment. __eot__ Brilliant. __eot__ Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there. __eot__ This is not my usual Friday night!
That sounds good. __eot__ Two.
Here's to. An interesting experience. __eot__ I'll drink to that.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it. __eot__ Why not? __eot__ It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you. __eot__ It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car? __eot__ Yeah, but. __eot__ Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay? __eot__ OK. __eot__ Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit. __eot__ I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee. __eot__ I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went. __eot__ I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over. __eot__ Oh, okay, can I call? __eot__ Okay, yeah, call. __eot__ Look, it can wait till Sunday. __eot__ Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep? __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ I'm going to wait here until she comes. __eot__ Are you sure? __eot__ I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
Okay, thanks. __eot__ I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert. __eot__ That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay? __eot__ Okay, okay. Bye.
Well, how did it go? What happened? __eot__ Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved. __eot__ What did you see? __eot__ Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?
What's with Mike? __eot__ He got a little jealous. __eot__ I'm sorry, I didn't... __eot__ It's okay. Don't worry about it.
You want a Dairy Queen? __eot__ No way. I'm about to blow up.
You want to tell me about it? __eot__ OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man. __eot__ Wow. Should you tell my father? __eot__ I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble. __eot__ You saw a lot in one night. __eot__ Actually. I've been in twice. __eot__ Twice. Without her sensing anything? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Did you see her undressed? __eot__ Yeah. I mean a little, you know. __eot__ Yeah? __eot__ That doesn't bother you, does it? __eot__ Who, me? Why should it? __eot__ That's what I thought. __eot__ You're sure right. It is a strange world. __eot__ Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world? __eot__ I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble. __eot__ Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl. __eot__ So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back. __eot__ I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey. __eot__ I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
Okay, be careful. __eot__ Okay, Sandy.
Can I give you a kiss good night? __eot__ You better not, Jeffrey. __eot__ Okay, okay. __eot__ Goodnight. __eot__ See ya tomorrow.
You were late. __eot__ I'm really sorry. __eot__ What am I going to do? __eot__ You want to go talk to him? __eot__ Yeah, but I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals. __eot__ That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today? __eot__ Shoot. __eot__ Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove? __eot__ Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other. __eot__ Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him. __eot__ Oh yeah? __eot__ Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken. __eot__ Jeffrey!! __eot__ Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place. __eot__ I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment? __eot__ Yeah. __eot__ Jeffrey? Why? __eot__ I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret. __eot__ You like mysteries that much? __eot__ Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.
You worry about me really? __eot__ Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble. __eot__ Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it. __eot__ Okay, but I promise I won't mention you. Okay? I'll see him at the police station, okay? See you Friday night, if not before.
Everything okay? __eot__ Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on? __eot__ You didn't tell him about me? __eot__ No.
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on! __eot__ Okay. Great!
Okay. __eot__ What is it? __eot__ Just some fatherly advice.
What was that all about? __eot__ Nothing, really! It's good to see you. __eot__ It's good to see you. __eot__ Where to? __eot__ Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned? __eot__ I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime. __eot__ It's okay. __eot__ You look beautiful. __eot__ Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening? __eot__ I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
You want to dance? __eot__ I can't dance fast. __eot__ Really? __eot__ Really. You want to dance with someone else? __eot__ NO. __eot__ Let's wait for some slow one. __eot__ Just a minute.
You want to dance? __eot__ Okay.
Oh my God. What's wrong? __eot__ Frank!!!
My father has a gun at home. __eot__ No. __eot__ Sandy, this guy is a killer!! I promise you.
Dorothy!... Dorothy! __eot__ Dorothy Vallens? __eot__ Yes.
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her? __eot__ No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house? __eot__ Probably not. No. Why? __eot__ Okay. Let's get her over to your father's. __eot__ Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
Jeffrey? What's going on? __eot__ Shhh. I'll tell you.
I should go with her, Sandy. __eot__ Go ahead. __eot__ Sandy? __eot__ Go ahead!
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now. __eot__ No Jeffrey!! __eot__ Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me.
Look Jeffrey. __eot__ Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you. __eot__ Yeah, nice meetin' you.
What are watchin' this junk for? __eot__ You can change it if you want to. __eot__ I don't know why we have to watch TV. __eot__ Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute? __eot__ Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
Come on out a minute, okay? __eot__ Okay.
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house. __eot__ Stop it Mike. __eot__ You shut up. Nobody's talkin' to you. Hey who's that Jeffrey? Your mother?
What did he bring him in for? __eot__ Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away. __eot__ Just for him? __eot__ Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there. __eot__ Up where? __eot__ Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid. __eot__ Oh fuck!
Fuck you. __eot__ Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around. __eot__ I bounced you on my knee at family reunions, for Christ sakes. Your dad and me ran the whole east coast syndicate you snot-nosed little prick. And when you took the wheel, who was beside you?
Hey, I just... __eot__ Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver? __eot__ I need Il Duce. __eot__ The Duke?  What did you do? __eot__ This kid, this package boy could bring down the whole east coast. If he decides to turn states he could dismantle us... totally. But it looks like for now, he's content with just killing us one by one. And even worse the kid is good at it. I mean I had a prodigy on my hands the whole time and didn't even know it.
Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here. __eot__ Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something. __eot__ Your dad and I used him three times over twenty years, only when everything went totally fucked. Believe me kid, you don't want this guy unless you are 100% sure you need him. He is... a fuckin' monster.
There's ways around that. __eot__ Go find one.
Lord's name. __eot__ Mother Mary, full of grace. __eot__ What did you do, Connor?
Well listen, I know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'. __eot__ Yes mother. __eot__ I mean it now. I carried the two of you little bastards around in my belly at the same time you ungrateful pissants. Ya ruined my girlish figure in one fell swoop, and then ya sucked me dry.  My tits are saggin' down ta my ankles. I trip over em for Christ sakes, now ya listen ta me, NO FIGHTEN!
Are ya ready? __eot__ Aye.
Yes sir. __eot__ Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.
Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue. __eot__ I can't find the second one, sir. __eot__ Look under the body. __eot__ Got it.
Are these me considered armed and dangerous? __eot__ Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.
Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one. __eot__ Any tips on where these guys may be? __eot__ Any word back from the E.R.s?
Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem. __eot__ What? __eot__ The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do? __eot__ You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man! __eot__ Where's your gun? __eot__ Chest pocket.  Shit! __eot__ This is a six-shooter.
Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them? __eot__ Let's do him right here.
What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!! __eot__ Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS! __eot__ Get a hold of yourself, man.
Anybody you think is evil? __eot__ Yes. __eot__ Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird? __eot__ Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.
Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco. __eot__ Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.
Donna's gonna be angry about her cat. __eot__ Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole. __eot__ You sound real remorseful.
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow. __eot__ Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night. __eot__ What? __eot__ Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room? __eot__ What are you saying? __eot__ Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets. __eot__ You think they sold me out? No way. __eot__ He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy? __eot__ No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it? __eot__ He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years? __eot__ No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it. __eot__ Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in. __eot__ No, look. No rolling. Nothing needs to be rolled.
Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out! __eot__ What happened? __eot__ I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em all!!
What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview. __eot__ Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!
Anybody see ya? __eot__ Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
Yeah, well... __eot__ Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?
I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who. __eot__ MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!
What the fuck are you doing? __eot__ I-I'll tip her.
What? What is it? __eot__ This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
Oh man. You gotta let me do these guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make up for the tit thing. __eot__ No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole. __eot__ Aw, c'mon. I gotta clear my family name here. I've brought shame to the house of Della Rocco.
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit. __eot__ Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit. __eot__ C'mon!
Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you fuckin' know! __eot__ Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!
Look again for fuck sake! __eot__ I know what the fuck he looks like!
Shit. __eot__ What?  What, that guy?
They got nothing. __eot__ This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
